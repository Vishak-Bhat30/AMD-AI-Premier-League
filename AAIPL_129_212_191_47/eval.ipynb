His neighbors face away, and their surnames are Gail and Gopal. Shankar is facing away, and his neighbors face opposite directions. Srajit's surname is Garv, facing center, and sits third to the right of Sashi, whose surname is Gail. The Girish surname isn't next to Gail or Srajit. Shirish is opposite Sanjay, both facing same direction, and neither has surname Gopal. One of them is Girish. Shankar is opposite Gandhi, who's next to Shirish. Sunder's surname isn't Goyal and is facing center. Now, who's next to Suresh? Let's see. Suresh must be facing away since Sajal is facing center and his neighbors are away. Suresh's neighbor would be someone facing away. Sajal's neighbors are Gail and Gopal, but Suresh is another person. Wait, maybe Suresh is next to Sajal? But Sajal's neighbors are Gail and Gopal. Wait, Srajit is facing center, third to the right of Sashi. Sashi's surname is Gail. So Sajal's neighbors are Gail and Gopal, but Gail is Sashi. So Sajal's left is Gail (Sashi), right is Gopal. Then Shankar is facing away, and his neighbors are opposite. Then Suresh's neighbor would be someone facing away. Since Sajal is facing center, his left is Gail (Sashi), right is Gopal. Then Suresh must be next to Gopal or Gail. But Sajal's neighbors are Gail and Gopal. Wait, maybe Suresh is next to Sajal's neighbor, Gopal. But Sajal's neighbors are Gail and Gopal. If Suresh is next to Gopal, then Suresh's surname would be... Hmm. Also, Shankar is opposite Gandhi, who is next to Shirish. So Shankar is facing away, and his neighbors face opposite.

      "Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have six friends sitting around a square table, each with different professions. The key is to figure out who is sitting to the immediate right of Surya. \n",

      "First, let's note the given conditions. Tarini, the Scientist, is second to the left of Qadir and to the left of the Lawyer. Qadir is at a corner facing away from the center. The person to his right is also at a corner. Umesh isn't next to Qadir and is facing the Doctor. Surya, the Teacher, is next to the Lawyer but not next to Tarini. Rithesh isn't at the edge. The neighbors of Prakash face different directions. The Scientist isn't to the right of the Banker, and the Banker isn't at the edge. The edge sitters face each other.\n",

Wait, but the Lawyer is to the left of Tarini, who is second to the left of Qadir. That would mean the Lawyer is between Qadir and Tarini. Then Surya, the Teacher, is next to the Lawyer. So Surya is next to the Lawyer, making the Lawyer's right neighbor Surya. But the question is who is to the right of Surya. Wait, the Lawyer is to the left of Tarini, so the Lawyer's right is Tarini? But Surya is next to the Lawyer. So Surya is on the right of the Lawyer. Then the person to the right of Surya would be... Hmm, maybe the Lawyer is on the left, Surya is next to them, so the right of Surya would be the next person. Wait, but the Lawyer is to the left of Tarini, so the Lawyer's right is Tarini. Then Surya is next to the Lawyer, so Surya is on the left of the Lawyer? No, that can't be. Wait, Tarini is second to the left of Qadir, so Qadir is on the left, Tarini is second to the left, then the Lawyer is to the left of Tarini.
