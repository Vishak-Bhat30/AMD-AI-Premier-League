Therefore, B is lying when he says exactly one of them is truthful. But then there are 2 truth-tellers, A and C, and this contradicts A's statement. Therefore, A is a liar. Since A is a liar, it is not true that exactly one of them is a liar. This means either zero or two or three liars. If B were a truth-teller, then there would be exactly one truth-teller. Since A is a liar, the one truth-teller would be B. But this is a contradiction because we already know A is a liar, and A's claim would have to be false, implying there are 0 or 2 or 3 liars. If B were a truth-teller, C would have to be a liar, and there would be 2 liars, A and C. But this is consistent with A's claim. But this means that B is telling the truth and is not a liar.

But if X is the Gun and Y is the Missile, Z cannot claim to be Robot. This is also consistent. Therefore, if Y is the Gun then Y's statement is true and Z is a Gun, contradiction. So therefore Z is the Gun.",

The only possible setup is for C to be the Gun, meaning either A or B is the Missile. If A is the Missile, A's statement is false. And B is robot, and B's statement is false as well. Therefore B is the only robot and not the missile. So, A is Missile. But A can never say it is the Gun, since it cannot say the truth.

This leaves only 2 possibilities, that Gamma is either the missile or a robot. If Gamma is the missile, then Alpha is not the gun, and Alpha's statement that Beta is the missile has to be true. Since Gamma is the missile, Beta is not the missile, so the assumption that Alpha is the gun is wrong. Assume Gamma is the robot. If Gamma is the Robot, and Alpha says Beta is the Missile, then it means Beta is the missile. Gamma also says alpha is the gun. Since we have assumed it is a robot, there is no contradiction. However, if alpha is the gun, then beta has to be the missile. The statement from beta that gamma is the robot can be true as well. There is no contradiction. So we cannot assume Alpha is the gun. If we assume Beta is the gun, then gamma is the robot and beta's statement is true. From here, the only thing left is to determine that alpha is the missile. So the answer is B.",

If Beta is telling the truth, then Gamma is telling the truth. But if Gamma is telling the truth, then Alpha is lying, which is consistent.

This is impossible, so A must be Verax and B & C are Falsax. If A is Verax, then B is Falsax. If B is Falsax, C is also Falsax. If C is Falsax, A is Verax. So A is Verax, B and C are Falsax, and there is only one Verax. The initial assumption that A is Verax leads to B and C being Falsax. So the statement 'B and I are of different tribes' is truthful. This means A must be Verax, and B & C must be Falsax. Thus only one Verax exists and B lied saying C is Verax. Since A is Verax saying B and himself are different types (true) B says C is Verax (lie) and C says A is Falsax (lie). If we assume A is Falsax, B must be Verax (the opposite of A's first statement) then C must be Verax, but C contradicts this. Therefore, A is Verax, B and C are Falsax. So there is only one Verax: A. But the question asks how MANY are Verax. Therefore the question is impossible under the constraints given and we must have two verax.

If B is a Knave, he's lying that A is a Knight, and this works, because A is a Knave. But if B is a Knight, he is telling the truth that A is a Knight, but A is a Knave.

C's statement 'A is a Zora' is true, which is consistent with our initial assumption. Thus, A and C are Zoras, and B is a Ban, so only 1 Ban is present. However, if C is a Zora, B has to be a Ban. If B is a Ban, A has to be a Ban, which contradicts the fact that A said that B and A are from different tribes. Thus, A must be a Ban. This means that A's statement, 'B and I are from different tribes' is false, implying that A and B are from the same tribe. Therefore, B is also a Ban. Since B is a Ban, B's statement 'C is a Ban' is false, implying that C is a Zora. C's statement 'A is a Zora' is also false, because we already know A is a Ban. So the assumption that A is a Ban is incorrect. Let's assume A is a Ban. Then, A's statement 'B and I are from different tribes' is false, meaning A and B are from the same tribe. Therefore, B is also a Ban. Since B is a Ban, the statement 'C is a Ban' is false, which means C is a Zora. So, A and B are Bans and C is a Zora, meaning there are two Bans present.

This means both Anya and Boris are innocent, and only Chandra is guilty, which contradicts that only one thief exists. If Chandra is telling the truth, Anya is innocent.

This means there are at least two people from the Lies (A and B). But A said 'exactly one of us is a liar', which is a contradiction if A is from the Lies. Thus, A is telling the truth. Since exactly one is from the Lies, and we need to resolve between B and C, if B is from the Lies, his statement is false, meaning A is from the lies, contradicting A's truthful statement. Therefore, B must be telling the truth, and C is from the Lies. But we also know that only one is a liar. Therefore, A must be from the lies. If A is lying then at least 2 of the three are liars.

If B is wearing the White mask, B's statement could be true or false. However, if A is wearing the Red mask, then A's statement is true, but only one can be wearing the Red mask. If B is wearing the Red mask, then B's statement is true, but only one can be wearing the Red mask. Thus, C must be wearing the Black mask, but this is impossible. \n\nTherefore, A must be wearing the Black mask. If A is wearing the Black mask, then A's statement is false. If B is wearing the Red mask, then B's statement is true and A is wearing the Black mask. If C is wearing the White mask, his statement is random. This is self-consistent. ",

If B is a Ban, then B's statement is false, so C is a Ban. But if C is a Ban, C's statement is false, so A is a Zorn, which is a contradiction. Therefore, A must be a Zorn, B is a Ban, and C is a Ban. However the question asks for the identity of C, and from the assumption that A is a Zorn, then C is a Ban. From the assumption that A is a Ban, C is a Ban. Therefore, we know that C must be a Ban. If B is a Ban, then B's statement that C is a Zorn is false, meaning C is a Ban. If C is a Ban, then C's statement that A is a Ban is false meaning A is a Zorn. This result is consistent with A being a Zorn and B being a Ban. Thus C is a Ban.",

Vorn says 'Thalon is the Gun' which is false, making Vorn the Missile. This cannot be the case because there is only one Missile. Therefore, Merek cannot be the Gun. Assume Vorn is the Gun. Then his statement ('Thalon is the Gun') is true, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Vorn cannot be the Gun. If Vorn is the Gun, then Thalon's statement is false, meaning Merek is NOT the missile.

If Z is wearing the White mask, Z can lie, so X does not have to be wearing Red. Now, Assume X is wearing the Black mask. Then Y is NOT wearing the Black mask. Y says Z is wearing the White mask. Since X is lying, Y is not wearing black. Thus Y is either Red or White. If Y is Red, then Z is White, meaning Zs statement is not true, so X is not wearing Red, which is consistent. If Y is White, then Z can be Black or Red. If Z is Black, then X is not Red, consistent. If Z is Red, then X is Red, which is contradiction. Now, Assume X is wearing the White mask. Y says, \"Z is wearing the White mask.\" Z says, \"X is wearing the Red mask.\" If Z is lying, X is not red. If Z is telling the truth, X is red, contradiction. If X is Red, then Y is Black, and Z is Red, which is not true, therefore X must be Black. So, Y must be Black.",

This creates a contradiction: both Missile and Robot are the thief, which is impossible. Thus, Gun must be lying, meaning Gun is the Missile.

Missile said \"Robot did not commit the theft,\" which must be a lie, meaning Robot did commit the theft. This is also impossible. Now assume Robot is telling the truth. Missile said \"Robot did not commit the theft\", meaning Robot did not commit the theft. This means the Robot has to lie, which is impossible.

Now, since A is Ban, B and C are of the same tribe. Since A is Ban, B's statement \"A is a Ban\" is true, so B is a Zor. Since A is Ban, C's statement \"A is a Zor\" is false, so C is a Ban.

Because B is Zor and C is Ban, they are NOT the same tribe, so A must be telling the truth, and thus we have a contradiction. Let's start from the top, but say that A is Ban. Then, B and C must be of the same tribe. Since A is Ban, B's statement \"A is Ban\" is TRUE, so B must be Zor. Since A is Ban, C's statement \"A is Zor\" is FALSE, so C must be Ban.

If Robot's statement 'I am Robot' is false, this does not cause a contradiction. Now consider if Gun's statement 'I am not Robot' is true. Missile's statement 'Gun is Robot' is false. If Robot said 'I am Robot', and we assume he is lying, then he is not Robot. If Robot said 'I am Robot', and we assume he is telling the truth, then he is Robot. Missile must be the Robot. If Missile is the Robot, and he's lying when he says 'Gun is Robot', that means Gun is not Robot, which is consistent. If Gun is Gun, and he's telling the truth that 'I am not Robot', and Missile is the Robot and lying, then that works. Robot must be Missile.",

If Merek is a Zub, Vorn is a Zub, which is impossible. So Merek is a Zib. Since Vorn says Thalon is a Zib, and Thalon is a Zib, Vorn must be lying, so Vorn is also a Zib. Thus, there are 3 Zibs, contradicting Thalon's statement. This is impossible. Since Thalon is a Zib, more than one is a Zib. If Vorn is telling the truth, Thalon is a Zub, which is impossible.

If A is a Knave, B's statement is false, so B is a Knave. C's statement is true, so C is a Knight. This means there are two knaves (A and B), satisfying the false statement of A. However, if there are two Knaves, A's statement is that there is *exactly* one Knave and so A's statement would be false.

Therefore, A is Falsax. If A is Falsax, then 'exactly one of us is Falsax' is FALSE, meaning there are either 0 or 2 Falsax. Since A is a Falsax, there must be another. B and C contradict each other, so one must be Verax and one Falsax. Since A is Falsax, and there must be two Falsax total, either B or C is the second Falsax. Therefore, the other is Verax. If B were Falsax, A is Verax would be false, which is consistent. If C were Falsax, A is Falsax would be false, which is a contradiction. Therefore, C must be Verax, which makes A and B Falsax. Therefore, B is Verax, making C Falsax. Since there are exactly two Falsax, and A is Falsax, one of B or C must be Falsax and the other Verax. Since A said only one is Falsax, and that is false, there must be two Falsax. Therefore, only A can be Falsax. A is lying about the number of liars. B is truthfully claiming A is Verax and C is truthfully claiming A is a Falsax is impossible. If A is lying, and two are liars, then B must be telling the truth. If B is telling the truth then A is Verax which contradicts our initial assumptions. If A is lying then two of them are liars. If B is a liar, then A is a Verax, a contradiction.

Since Thalon is lying about the number of liars, there must be either zero or two or three liars. If Vorn is a Liar, he is telling the truth, a contradiction. Hence, Vorn is a Truth-teller. Since there are not zero Liars (Thalon is a Liar), there must be two Liars. Thalon and one of the other two. Since Vorn is a Truth-teller, Merek must be a Truth-teller, and therefore Thalon and Vorn are the only Truth-tellers on the island.

But C could be the missile. If A = Robot, then B = Missile is true/false. If A is Robot, B = Gun, then statement is true. So B would be Gun, but says I am Robot. This is a contradiction. If B = Missile, then the statement is false, but B is lying. So A is Robot, B is missile. C states that A is Gun. A is not Gun, therefore C is lying. Therefore C is missile.

If Z is Robot and lies, X is Gun. X cannot be Gun. Now assume X is Missile. Y is not Missile. Y says Z is Gun. Z says X is Robot. Since X is Missile, Y must be lying. Thus, Z is not a Gun. Therefore, Z is either a Missile or Robot. If Y is lying about Z being Gun, and Z is lying about X being a Robot, then X is Gun. Impossible. If Y is lying about Z being Gun, and Z is truthfully saying X is robot, X is robot. Impossible. The only consistent solution is X is the Missile.",

If A is Ban, then the statement 'exactly one of us is Ban' is false, meaning there are either zero or two or three Bans. If A is Ban, and B is Zorn, then A and C are of the same tribe, meaning C is Ban. Then there are two Bans, which is consistent with A being Ban.

Then Z's statement is false, so Z wears Black. This can't happen since X wears Black. If X wears White, his statement could be true or false. If his statement is true, X wears Red - impossible.

Since A is lying, B and C must be from the same tribe, and A is of the same tribe as either B or C. If A is lying, then A's statement 'B and C are not of the same tribe' is false. So, B and C are of the same tribe. If B is a Zorn, B's statement that A is a Zorn is true, which contradicts our assumption that A is a Ban. So B must be a Ban. C's statement 'A is a Ban' must be a lie. So C is a Zorn. This again contradicts our assumption that B and C are from the same tribe. Therefore, A must be a Zorn. If A is a Zorn, then B is a Zorn and C is a Ban. Therefore, C is a Zorn.",

If Alpha is a Robot, then Alpha can make the statement that Beta is a missile, and be truthful. Because Gamma is a Gun, Beta's statement is false, therefore Beta is a Missile. This configuration works. The roles are: Gamma = Gun, Alpha = Robot, Beta = Missile. Therefore, only Gamma can be the Gun. If Gamma is a Gun, then Alpha is a Robot (true), so Alpha could either be telling the truth or lying. Alpha is correct if Beta is a missile.

But this contradicts the rule that only one is a Ban, because if A and B are Zors, C has to be a Ban. Since A's statement cannot be true, A must be a Ban. Now, if A is a Ban, A's statement is false, meaning B and A are NOT the same. Since A is a Ban, B must be a Zor. If B is a Zor, then B's statement that C is a Ban is true. Therefore, C is a Ban. This contradicts the rule that exactly one is a Ban. This is our mistake -- If A is Ban then B is a Zor and since only 1 Ban can exist, C MUST be a Zor as well. If B stated that C is Ban and B is Zor, that statement is true. This is a contradiction, so let's review: A is a Ban, therefore B is not the same as A. This means B has to be Zor. If B is Zor, he states that C is Ban. This is true, so C is indeed a Ban. This means two Bans exist (A and C), which cannot be, as there is only one Ban. However, there is a constraint that exactly one is a ban, so if A is ban then A's statement that A and B are of the same type must be false. This means they are NOT the same. So B must be a Zor. If B is a Zor then B's statement C is Ban must be true. Therefore, C is a Ban. BUT there is only one ban allowed. This contradicts all premises. However, if A is Ban then his statement is false which means A and B are NOT of the same type. If A is Ban then B has to be Zor. If B is Zor, he claims that C is Ban. If C is Ban, then there are two bans, A and C. This contradicts rule one ban. Therefore, the assumption that A is ban must be wrong. So let's assume B is the ban. If B is the ban, then his statement is false, which means that C is NOT a ban. If C is not a ban, then C is a Zor. If C is a Zor then his statement is true, which makes A also a Zor. If A is a Zor, then his statement is also true, meaning he is the same type as B. This makes B also a Zor. BUT B cannot be a zor, because we assumed that B is a Ban. Now let's assume C is the Ban. If C is the ban, his statement is false, so A is NOT a zor. This means A is a Ban. This contradicts the rule there is only one Ban. Now we come full circle. A is a Ban.",

If A is Missile, then B's statement is false, so A is not Missile. This is a contradiction. Thus, A cannot be Gun or Missile, and A must be Robot. Since A is Robot, A's statement, \"I am Robot\" could be true or false. Now consider B's statement. If B is Gun, B's statement is true, so A is Missile. This contradicts our conclusion that A is Robot. If B is Missile, B's statement is false, so A is not Missile. This aligns with A being Robot. If B is Robot, B's statement could be true or false. Thus, B could be anything. Now consider C's statement. If A is Robot and B is Missile, then C must be Gun. So C is not Missile, therefore C's statement is true. So the only solution is: A is Robot, B is Missile, and C is Gun and therefore is the only one telling the truth, with B lying. However, this is incorrect. Let's reassess. If A is Robot, A's statement can be true or false. If A is Gun, then A tells the truth. Therefore, A is Robot, which is a contradiction. If A is Missile, then A lies, which is consistent. B claims A is Missile. If B is Gun, then A is Missile. If B is Missile, then A isn't Missile. If B is Robot, A could be Missile or not. C claims that C is not missile.

If A is a Liar, then the statement 'exactly one is a liar' is false, meaning there are either zero or two or three liars. If there were zero liars, A would be a truth-teller. If there were two liars, B would be a liar, which is a contradiction since A and C would be of different types, which would mean B's statement is true. If all three were liars, then A's statement would be false, therefore this case is valid. B would be lying that A and C are of the same type (which they are). Therefore A is a liar, B is a liar, and C is a liar. But if C is a liar, then A and C are the same type. This means B has told the truth, contradicting our assumption that B is a liar.

If Agent Z is telling the truth, then X is lying. If X is lying, then Y is not guilty. So Y is telling the truth, and there would be two truth-tellers, a contradiction. Thus, only Agent X telling the truth is valid, meaning Agent Y is guilty. But the question says only one is telling the truth, thus X must be lying. If X is lying, Y is not guilty. Since only one is guilty, Y is not guilty. If Y is lying, Y is guilty, a contradiction. Thus, Agent X is lying. Assume that Agent X is guilty. Then both agents Y and Z are telling the truth, that is a contradiction. Therefore, there is a problem in the original question. The original question is that only one agent is telling the truth. That cannot be the case. Assume Agent X is guilty, then Y and Z will tell the truth, and there will be two persons telling the truth. If Agent Y is guilty, X is telling the truth. So Agent X is the only truth teller. If Agent Z is guilty, then Y is telling the truth. But then there are two truth tellers! Since only one agent is telling the truth, Agent X is telling the truth and Y is the guilty party. However, if only one is telling the truth, then it can be concluded that Agent X is lying. So Agent X cannot be guilty. If we suppose that Agent Z is guilty, then Agent Y is telling the truth. This violates the rules of the game. Therefore, Agent X is guilty and the guilty party is Agent X.",

If A were a Ban, then A's statement would be false, meaning either zero or two or three are Bans. If A, B, and C were all Bans, then B's statement would be false, which is consistent. Also, C's statement would be false, which is consistent. But A's statement would be false, which is consistent. But in this case there are three bans and not exactly one, so this case can't occur. If two were Bans: let A and B be Bans and C be a Zor. A's statement is false, so not exactly one is a Ban. B's statement is false. C's statement is A is a Ban, which is true, since C is a Zor.

If Merek is a Knave, his statement that Vorn is a Knight is false, making Vorn a Knave, which is also consistent. So, if Thalon is a Knight, there are two Knaves (Merek and Vorn). Assume Thalon is a Knave. Then it's false that exactly one is a Knave, meaning there are either zero or two Knaves. If Thalon is a Knave, then Vorn's statement that Thalon is a Knave is true, making Vorn a Knight. This contradicts Thalon's statement that there are zero or two Knaves because now we have at least one Knight and one Knave (Thalon). Then Merek must be a Knave as well in order to satisfy the zero or two Knaves condition. However, if Merek is a Knave, then Merek's statement \"Vorn is a Knight\" is false, which means Vorn must be a Knave. This is a contradiction. Therefore, Thalon must be a Knight, and there are two Knaves (Merek and Vorn).",

Now, assume A is a Zil. Then B and C are of the same tribe. If B is a Zod, then A is a Zod (contradiction). If B is a Zil, then A is a Zil (consistent). Then C is also a Zil, and C says A is a Zil (consistent). Therefore, A is a Zil, B is a Zil, and C is a Zil, but this contradicts A's statement. Thus, A must be a Zod. This means B and C are different tribes. If B is a Zod, A is a Zod (true), and C is a Zil, and A is not a Zil (true). So, we have A (Zod), B (Zod), C(Zil). The number of Zils is one. Now if B is a Zil, A is not a Zod (false), and C is a Zod, and A is a Zil (false). Since A is a Zod, B must be a Zod, and C must be a Zil. Therefore, there are two Zils, B is a Zil and C is a Zil, which contradicts that A is a Zod. Now, since A is Zod, B and C are different. If B is Zod, then A is Zod (true), C is Zil, so A is Zil (false). Thus C is Zil. Thus one Zil. Now, if B is Zil, then A is Zod (false). Thus B is Zod. Thus there are two Zils. Thus the answer is C.",

The following conditions are true: A sits next to B and C, but C does not sit next to E. D sits on the immediate left of F, who sits on the immediate right of G. H sits on the opposite end of the arrangement from J. I does not sit next to G or H. If person E is sitting exactly three positions from the northernmost person, which of the following statements about the seating arrangement is true?",

            "D) G sits on the immediate left of C"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From the given conditions, we can deduce that C is not next to E, so C must be in the northernmost or southernmost position. Since H sits on the opposite end from J, H must be in the southernmost position. F sits on the immediate right of G, so G must be in the northernmost position, and F is second from the north. D sits on the immediate left of F, so D is third from the north. E is three positions from the north, so E is sixth from the north. C is not next to E, so C must be either first or seventh from the north. Since B sits next to A and C, B must be second from the north, and A is first from the north. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."

This contradicts 'exactly one is a Ban'. Therefore, if A is a Zor, B must be a Ban. If B is a Ban, then A and C are of different tribes. Since A is a Zor, C must be a Ban. This satisfies the condition that exactly one is a Ban (only C). So A is Zor, B is Ban, and C is Ban is impossible. Now assume A is a Ban. Then it is false that exactly one of them is a Ban. This means either zero or two or three are Bans. If B is a Zor, then A and C are the same tribe, so C is also a Ban. Now A and C are Bans, so exactly two are Bans. This is consistent with A's statement being a lie. If A is a Ban and B is a Zor, then C is also a Ban. Thus A, B, and C are Ban, Zor, Ban respectively. Therefore the correct answer is B.",

If A and B are Knaves, A's statement is false, meaning A and B are *not* the same type, which is consistent. B's statement is then, 'C is a Knave,' which is false, so C must be a Knight. This is consistent. If C is a Knave, then at least 2 are Knights. If A is a Knight, B must also be a Knight, which contradicts C being a Knave. If A is a Knave, then B must also be a Knave, then B is lying about C being a Knave, so C is a Knight, but that's a contradiction. Therefore, A=Knave, B=Knave, C=Knight.",

Robot's statement 'Gun is lying' must be true since Robot can say anything. Therefore, Gun is Missile. If Gun is Missile, then Missile must be Gun. This contradicts our initial assumption, so let's consider the original assumption. Gun's statement is that Robot is lying, and since Robot is Robot, Robot could be lying. Therefore, Gun could be telling the truth if Robot is lying. If Robot is lying then Gun is lying, which contradicts the initial assumption. So the only way to resolve the contradiction is to say that Gun is Missile. If Gun is Missile, and Missile always lies, then Gun's statement would have to be false, which it is, since if the Robot is lying, then Gun is lying, and thus is a missile. Missile says 'I am Robot' which would have to be false since Missile must lie, and we already know that Robot is Robot. Therefore, Gun is Missile.",

Then Beta's statement is true, so Gamma is the Missile. This is possible. Assume Gamma is the Gun. Then Gamma's statement is true, so Alpha is the Gun. This is a contradiction since only one robot can be the Gun. Therefore, Gamma is not the Gun. If Beta is the Missile, Beta's statement is false, making Gamma not the Missile. Alpha would then be the Robot. But then Alpha's statement would be true, meaning Alpha is not the Robot, so this is possible. Now if Alpha is the missile, Alpha's statement is false, making Alpha the Robot. Impossible. If Gamma is the Missile, then Beta is the Gun, and Alpha is the Robot. Then Gamma's statement about Alpha being the Gun is false, matching the Missile robot. Therefore, since only Alpha can be the Gun, and Gamma's statement implicates Alpha as the Gun, it must be Gamma making the truthful statement. Thus, Gamma is the Gun.",

C's statement is false (A is a Knight), so C is a Knave. This scenario has one Knave (C), consistent with A's statement. Now assume A is a Knave. Then A's statement is false, meaning there are either zero Knaves or two or three Knaves. If A is a Knave, B's statement is false (A is not a Knight) so B is also a Knave. C's statement is true (A is a Knave) so C is a Knight. This results in two Knaves, consistent with A's false statement. However, if A is a knave, his statement 'exactly one of us is a knave' is false, so there must be either 0 knaves or 2 or 3 knaves. If there are 2 knaves, then B is a knave and C is a knight. But A being a knave makes C's statement true, and C is thus a knight. Thus, A must be a knave. B must also be a knave and C must be a knight. Therefore, A is a Knave.",

Thus, B is also a Ban. If B is a Ban, B's statement is false, meaning C is a Ban. C's statement (A is a Ban) is now true, which is consistent since C is a Ban and must lie. However, this is impossible as C has to lie. So the initial assumption that A is a Zorn is wrong. If A is a Ban, then A's statement is false. Thus A and B are from the same tribe (Bans). B then lies, meaning C is a Ban. C lies meaning A is a Zorn. This is impossible because A is a Ban. If A is a Ban then A's statement is false. That means A and B are of the same tribe. So B is a Ban. B says C is a Zorn so this is a lie meaning C is a Ban. C says A is a Ban. This is a lie. This is consistent so A is a Ban, B is a Ban, and C is a Ban. This is impossible because exactly one of them is a Zorn. If B is a Zorn, B's statement is true and C is a Zorn. This contradicts A being a Zorn. If A is a Ban, A's statement is false.

This means C is a Ban. Since A, B, and C are all Bans, this breaks the condition that exactly one of them is a Zorn. Let us assume that B is a Zorn. Therefore, C is a Zorn. This is a contradiction. If B is a Zorn, B's statement is true, making C a Zorn. But A is a Zorn, so A's statement is true. Since C is a Zorn, C's statement must be true, making A a Ban. This is a contradiction.

This implies Gamma is the Robot, and Gamma claims Alpha is the Gun. Since Alpha IS the Gun, Gamma is telling the truth, but Gamma must be either Missile or Robot. Contradiction. Assume Beta is the Gun. Then Gamma is the Robot. This means Alpha is the Missile. Alpha's statement that \"Beta is a Missile\" is a lie, which fits. Beta's statement that \"Gamma is the Robot\" is the truth, which fits. Gamma's statement \"Alpha is the Gun\" could be true or false, and since Gamma is the Robot, this is possible. Assume Gamma is the Gun. Then Alpha is the Gun. Beta says Gamma is the Robot, which implies Beta is a Missile. This implies Gamma is the Robot. But this is a contradiction. Thus, only beta can be the gun. \nIf beta is the gun, gamma is the robot, and alpha is the missile. \nThen alpha says Beta is Missile, which is not true. So alpha is the missile. \nBeta says gamma is the robot, so this is true and beta is the gun. \nGamma says alpha is the gun, and this could be either true or false, so gamma is robot. \nAlternatively, if alpha is the robot, then alpha could lie or tell the truth. So we cannot determine this. Therefore, it must be that Gamma is the Robot only when Alpha is the Robot. If Alpha is the gun, then beta cannot be a missle. Gamma is the robot. This means Alpha is lying which is impossible. If Alpha is the robot, then this can hold, and thus the gamma can be a robot. \nSo, Alpha is the Robot.",

This is consistent. However, if B is the Missile, B's statement 'A is the Gun' would be false, which is consistent. C's statement 'B is not the Gun' would be true, making C the Gun, which is impossible since A is the Gun. Therefore, A cannot be the Gun. Now assume B is the Gun. Then B's statement ('A is the Gun') is true, meaning A is the Gun which we've shown is impossible. Therefore, C must be the Gun, making their statement ('B is not the Gun') true. This means A and B are either the Missile or the Robot. Since A says 'I am not the Robot', and they are not the Gun, they must be the Missile. Therefore B must be the Robot. If A is the Missile, their statement 'I am not the Robot' is false which is consistent. If C is the Gun, their statement 'B is not the Gun' is true. The missile is A, the Gun is C and B is the Robot. Thus the Missile is A.",

If A is a Ban (liar), then A and B are from the same tribe, both Bans. B says 'C is from the Zor tribe' which is false, so C is a Ban. But C says, 'A is from the Ban tribe' which is true, contradiction. So A is a Zor and B,C are Bans. However, we made an assumption about C. If C is Zor, then A is Ban, contradiction, so C has to be Ban. Only A is a Zor. So if A says 'B and I are from different tribes', which is true, so A is a Zor. If A is a Ban, this statement should be false. The statement should be false if both are from the same tribe. Then B says 'C is from the Zor tribe', which is false, so C is a Ban.

If B is Missile, B is lying so A is NOT Gun, which is consistent with our assumption. If C is Gun, then C is telling the truth, so C is Robot, contradiction. Therefore only the second case is a solution. If A is Missile, then B's statement (A is Gun) has to be a lie. Thus, B is Gun cannot be possible. If A is Missile, then B must be Gun so A being Gun is a lie. So B is Gun and C is Robot. Missile always lies. This is a valid possibility: A=Missile, B=Gun, C=Robot. A is Missile, so he lies. B is Gun, so he tells the truth when he says A is Gun, which is not true. Then we know it doesn't work. Final case is: Robot is C. C says 'I am Robot.'

Therefore, A is a Truther, B is a Liar, and C is a Liar. However, this means C and B are Liars, contradicting A\u2019s statement. B must be the Liar, so C must be the Truther since exactly one person is the liar. So, only possibility is A is a truther and C is a truther. This isn\u2019t possible since there must be exactly one liar. A must be a liar. If A is a liar, B is a liar, C is a truther, that means there is two liars which makes A statement false.

If Merek is a Knave then Vorn is a Knave, this would mean there are 3 Knaves, which is also a contradiction as Vorn's statement, 'Thalon is a Knave' would be true. Therefore, Thalon must be a Knight, and two are Knaves.",

This contradicts our assumption, so A must be a Fal. Since A is a Fal, A and B are different types, so B must be a Tris. Since B is a Tris, C must be a Fal. Since C is a Fal, A is not a Tris, which is consistent. Therefore, B is a Tris and C is a Fal. But now consider C's statement that A is a Tris. Since C is a Fal, this statement is false, meaning A is a Fal. This is consistent. The question asks how many Tris there are. Since B is a Tris and A and C are Fals, there is only one Tris. However, if we assume A is a Tris, then B is Tris and C is a Fal. C's statement is that A is a Tris, which is true. So C must be a Tris. This is a contradiction. Thus A must be a Fal, B a Tris, and C a Fal. A is a Fal, B is a Tris, C is a Fal. B said C is a Fal (truth). C said A is a Tris (lie). A said B and I are the same type (lie). Thus only B is a Tris. But if C is a Fal, then his statement, \"A is a Tris\" is a lie. Thus A is a Fal. So we have 2 Fals and 1 Tris. However, this doesn't work. If A is a Fal, his statement B and I are the same type is a lie. So they are different. So B is a Tris. B says C is a Fal. So C is a Fal. Therefore, there are 2 Fals and 1 Tris. This doesn't work with C's statement! Let's try it differently. If A is a Tris, then he is telling the truth. So A and B are the same type. So B is a Tris. So B's statement is true. C is a Fal. Then C's statement (A is a Tris) is a lie. So A is a Tris, B is a Tris, C is a Fal. There are two Tris. Now suppose A is a Fal, then B is a Tris, since A's statement is a lie. If B is a Tris, then B's statement is true (C is a Fal). Then C says that A is a Tris. Since C is a Fal, then A is a Fal. So A is a Fal, B is a Tris, C is a Fal.

Thus, Thalon is a Falsian. If Merek is Veridian, then Thalon and Vorn are Falsians. This means there are two Falsians, contradicting Thalon's statement (which must be false). Therefore, Merek is also a Falsian. Since Thalon and Merek are Falsians, and Thalon's statement \"Exactly one of us is a Falsian\" is false, it must be that Vorn is Veridian making Thalon's statement false. However, we know Thalon is a Falsian and must lie. Since Thalon and Merek are Falsians, Vorn must be a Veridian. This satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, only Thalon can be a Veridian.",

Then Robot 1 and Robot 3 are Gun and Robot in some order. If Robot 1 is the Gun, then Robot 1's statement is true: 'Robot 2 is the Missile'.

If Merek is a Knave, Vorn is a Knight, and only Merek is a Knave. This satisfies Thalon's statement. So Thalon is a Knight, Merek is a Knave, and Vorn is a Knight. However, Vorn says Thalon is a Knave, which is a lie. This makes Vorn a Knave, contradicting our assumption that Thalon is a Knight. Therefore, Thalon is a Knave. If Thalon is a Knave, then the statement \"exactly one of us is a Knave\" is false, meaning there are either zero or two or three Knaves. If Vorn is a Knight, then Thalon is a Knave, which we already know. If Vorn is a Knave, then Thalon is not a Knave, which is false. So, Merek is a Knight and Vorn is a Knave. Therefore Thalon and Vorn are Knaves. There are two Knaves.",

This is consistent so far. If A is Missile, B's statement is true, so B is Gun. Then C must be Robot. C's statement is false, but Robot can lie, so no contradiction. Now assume A is Robot. Then A's statement can be true or false. If A's statement is true (A is Robot), then B's statement is false, so A is not Missile (consistent). If A is Robot, and B is Missile, then C is Gun, and C's statement is true. This implies C is Gun which is acceptable. If A is Robot, and B is Gun, then C is Missile, and C's statement is false, so C is NOT Gun. This implies A is Robot and can be either true or false. Since C's statement must be false, C must be Missile. And since B lied, A cannot be Missile. Now we know C is Missile. B says A is Missile, and is lying. Thus A is not Missile and B is not Gun (since B lied). B must be Robot. Thus A must be Gun, meaning it lied by saying 'I am Robot'. This leads to a contradiction. Thus A must be Robot. If A is Robot, the possibilities are open, but since B says 'A is Missile', we can deduce that C is the Missile. Therefore A is Robot, B is Gun and C is Missile. A said 'I am Robot', which is something a Robot can say. Then B said 'A is Missile' which is a lie, making B either a robot or a missile. But since C is the missile, B must be the robot. That makes A the gun. Then A said 'I am Robot' which leads to a contradiction. So A must be Robot. Then B would have to be the liar or the Robot and C would be the Gun. Therefore, A is the Robot. A cannot be the gun since Gun always tells the truth. And A cannot be missile because then his statement is false, but he is claiming not to be Robot so that's a contradiction. Therefore A must be Robot.",

            "D) Zag, Zag, Zig"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Assume A is Zig. Then exactly one is a Zag. If B is Zig, then A and C are the same, so C is Zig. This contradicts 'exactly one Zag.' So, B is Zag, meaning A and C are different. Thus, C is Zag. This fits A's statement. So, A is Zig, B is Zag, C is Zig. Option B is the only valid one. If A is a Zag, then A's statement is false, meaning either zero or two or three Zags. If zero zags, A would be a Zig, contradiction. If two Zags, then B's statement must be false, and if B is Zig, A and C are the same, meaning 2 zags, which works. Then A is Zag, B is Zig, and C is Zag. If three, this is a contradiction. However, if A is Zag, B is Zig and C is Zag, then B's statement is False, which is consistent.",
