The photograph is of her cousin's father, which means the person in the photo is Priya's uncle. The question asks how the person in the photo is related to Priya. The man in the photo is the father of Priya's cousin, so he is Priya's maternal uncle. The son of Priya's maternal uncle is Priya's cousin. Thus, the person in the photo is her cousin's father and Priya's maternal uncle. But the question asks how the person in the photo relates to Priya, and the photo is of her cousin's father. So, the photo shows her cousin's father who is Priya's uncle. It looks like the answer is Uncle, but the phrase used in the question is 'father of my mother's only brother's son'. The mother's only brother's son is the cousin. The father of the cousin is the uncle. Therefore, the cousin is the person in the photo. So, Priya and the person in the photo are cousins.\",\n",
