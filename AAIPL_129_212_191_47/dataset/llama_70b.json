The following conditions are fulfilled: D is between E and F, G is not adjacent to H, C is seated to the immediate right of A, and B is two positions away from G. In which position is H seated?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Between C and D",
      "B) Between F and G",
      "C) Between A and E",
      "D) Between B and C"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "From the condition 'G is not adjacent to H', we know G can't be in the first or last position. Since C is to the right of A and B is two positions away from G, B must be in the 3rd or 5th position. Then, F must be in the 2nd or 4th position. Given D is between E and F, D must be in the 4th position, and E must be in the 3rd position. This leaves H to be in the 2nd position, which is between F and G."

      "D) Between M and O"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Since E sits third to the right of F, F must be in the first or second position. As F sits between A and B, A and B must be adjacent. I sits opposite K, so K must be in the 8th or 9th position, and I in the 2nd or 3rd. M sits adjacent to K, so M must be in the 7th or 8th position. As G does not sit opposite H, G must be in the 5th or 6th position. N is second to the left of O, so O must be in the 14th or 15th position, and N in the 13th or 14th. This leaves L to sit in the 4th position, making B the correct answer."

D and E are sitting together, but not next to A and F. J is sitting between B and H. B is sitting at least one position away from A. If G is sitting at position 3, then which of the following could be the arrangement?",

The following conditions apply: B is three positions to the right of G, C is exactly two positions to the left of F, D is not next to E, H is not next to I, and A is not in the same position as G.
