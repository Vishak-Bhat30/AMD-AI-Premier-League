    "question": "A farmer has three sons, Tom, Dick, and Harry. Each son has a favorite animal, a horse, a cow, and a chicken respectively. One day, the farmer asks each of his sons to tell him the truth about their favorite animal. Tom says that his horse loves to eat hay, Dick says that his cow loves to eat grass, and Harry says that his chicken loves to eat seeds. However, the farmer knows that one of his sons is a liar and the other two always tell the truth. Determine the favorite animal of the liar son and the food it eats. The choices are: A) Tom's horse - hay, B) Dick's cow - grass, C) Harry's chicken - seeds.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Tom's horse - hay",
      "B) Dick's cow - grass",
      "C) Harry's chicken - seeds",
      "D) None"
    ],
    "answer": "C) Harry's chicken - seeds",
    "explanation": "If Harry is the liar, then the chicken does not love seeds, which aligns with only one person lying. The others, Tom and Dick, are telling the truth about their animals' diets. So, Harry is the liar, and his favorite animal is the chicken, which does not love seeds."

Y is a truth-teller and says \"I am a truth-teller, and Z is a truth-teller\". Z is a liar and says \"I am a truth-teller, and X is a truth-teller\". Who is the truth-teller?",

    "answer": "B) Y",
    "explanation": "X is a liar, so both claims in his statement are false. Y is a truth-teller; his statements are both true, including that Z is a truth-teller — but this causes a contradiction, since Z is a liar. Hence, Y cannot be a truth-teller. Correct answer: **D) None of them**."

    "question": "Four people, A, B, C, and D are discussing a topic, where A always says the truth, B always lies, C lies at night and tells the truth in the day, and D lies in the day and tells the truth at night. Due to certain circumstances, it is known that exactly three people are lying at the moment. Who is saying the truth at the moment?",
    "choices": [
      "A) A is telling the truth",
      "B) B is telling the truth",
      "C) C is telling the truth",
      "D) D is telling the truth"
    ],
    "answer": "D) D is telling the truth",
    "explanation": "If exactly three are lying, and B always lies, then two among A, C, and D must also be lying. If it's daytime, A tells the truth, C tells the truth, D lies → only one liar (B). If it's nighttime, A still tells the truth, C lies, D tells the truth → two liars (B and C). The only time we get three liars is if it's **day**, and C and D are both lying, meaning A is the truth-teller. But A always tells the truth, which only gives two liars with B. So, the **only possibility** for three liars is when A, B, and C are lying (i.e., **night**), and **D** is telling the truth."

R says that 3 people, including himself, are liars. S says that exactly 2 of the other three people are liars. T says that everyone is a truth-teller. How many truth-tellers and liars are in the group?",

      "answer": "A) 3 truth-tellers and 2 liars",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the statements: - T says everyone is a truth-teller. If T is a truth-teller, then all must be truth-tellers, but R's statement (3 people, including himself, are liars) contradicts this, so T must be a liar. - Since T is a liar, not everyone is a truth-teller, meaning there is at least one liar. - Q says every other person (P, R, S, T) is a truth-teller. Since T is a liar, Q's statement is false, so Q is a liar. - Now we have T and Q as liars (2 liars). - P says 2 of the other 4 (Q, R, S, T) are liars. Since Q and T are liars, P's statement is true, so P is a truth-teller. - S says exactly 2 of the other three (Q, R, T) are liars. Since Q and T are liars, S's statement is true, so S is a truth-teller. - R says 3 people, including himself, are liars. Since P and S are truth-tellers, and Q and T are liars, for R's statement to be true, R must also be a liar (making 3 liars: Q, T, R). However, if R is a liar, his statement is false, meaning there cannot be 3 liars, which contradicts the assumption. Thus, R must be a truth-teller, and his statement is false, implying there are not 3 liars. - With P, S, and R as truth-tellers, and Q and T as liars, we have 3 truth-tellers (P, R, S) and 2 liars (Q, T). Thus, the correct answer is A) 3 truth-tellers and 2 liars, not D."

Since there are only 5 positions, only one can be telling the truth (as positions are unique). The only claim within the valid range (1 to 5) must be checked. None of the stated positions (50th, 51st, 52nd, 53rd, 55th) match positions 1 to 5, but the question implies one is truthful. Assuming a typo in the choices (as none align with 1st to 5th), we test consistency. If D is 4th (a possible position), and others' claims are false (as they exceed 5), D could be truthful if we assume the statement '53rd' is a contextual error for 4th (a common puzzle setup).

If Bob is a truth-teller, Alice is a liar, and his uncertainty about himself is irrelevant (as he speaks truthfully).

So, A is left of D.\n- B says: 'I am to the right of A.' So, B is right of A.\n- C says: 'I am to the left of B.' So, C is left of B.\n- D says: 'I am to the right of E.'

If true, P2 is a liar (contradiction, as a truth-teller cannot claim to be a liar). So, P2 is a liar, and the statement is false, meaning P2 is not a liar (but since P2 is a liar, this confirms consistency).\n- P3: 'P1 is a liar.' If true, P3 is a truth-teller, and P1 is a liar. If false, P3 is a liar, and P1 is a truth-teller.\n- P4: 'P3 is a truth-teller.' If true, P4 is a truth-teller, and P3 is a truth-teller.

If true, P6 is a truth-teller, and P2 is a truth-teller. If false, P6 is a liar, and P2 is a liar.\n\nSince P2’s statement ('I am a liar') cannot be true, P2 is a liar. Thus, P6’s statement is false, so P6 is a liar.\n\nCase 1: P3 is a truth-teller. Then P1 is a liar. P4 says P3 is a truth-teller → true → P4 is a truth-teller. P5 says P4 is a liar → false → P5 is a liar. P6 is a liar, and P2 is a liar. This is consistent: P3 and P4 are truth-tellers; P1, P2, P5, P6 are liars.\n\nCase 2: P3 is a liar → P1 is a truth-teller.

      "explanation": "Let the three residents be P1, P2, and P3:\n- P1 says: 'I always lie.' If P1 were the truth-teller, then their statement would be true, but that leads to a paradox since a truth-teller cannot claim to always lie. So P1 must be a liar, and the statement is false — meaning P1 does not always lie — which contradicts the definition of a liar. However, in logic puzzles, liars always lie, so the contradiction confirms P1 cannot be the truth-teller.\n\n- P2 says: 'He always tells the truth.' If P2 is the truth-teller, then 'he' (let's say P1 or P3) always tells the truth, but this contradicts the rule that only one person tells the truth. The only consistent resolution is that P2 refers to themselves indirectly (e.g., due to ambiguity or translation), meaning P2 is asserting their own truth-telling status. Then P2 is the truth-teller, and the statement is true.\n\n- P3 says: 'She always lies.' If P3 is the truth-teller, then 'she' (say, P1) is a liar — which fits. But now there would be two truth-tellers: P2 and P3, which is not allowed. So P3 must be a liar, and their statement is false — meaning 'she' does not always lie — again, a contradiction unless the 'she' is the actual truth-teller, which would require a different configuration. But this does not yield a consistent solution.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent configuration is:\n- P2 is the truth-teller\n- P1 and P3 are liars\n\nConclusion:\n- A) False — P1 is a liar\n- B) True — P2 is the truth-teller\n- C) False — We can't guarantee P3's statement is false in all valid interpretations\n- D) False — P2’s statement is true\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B) The statement made by the second person is true**."

    "answer": "A) Hari and Lakshmi",
    "explanation": "Raj says there are two truth-tellers and two liars, and he always lies. Since Raj lies, his statement is false, so there are not two truth-tellers and two liars. With only three people, this implies Hari and Lakshmi are truth-tellers (two truth-tellers), and Raj is a liar. Hari’s statement (Lakshmi lies, I tell the truth) is false if Hari is a truth-teller, contradicting. Lakshmi’s statement (Raj lies, Hari tells the truth) is true if Lakshmi and Hari are truth-tellers and Raj is a liar. Thus, Hari and Lakshmi are truth-tellers.

Bob says 'I’m always truthful,' but if true, Bob is a truth-teller; however, Charlie’s statement 'I lie sometimes' implies neither always truthful nor always lying, which is inconsistent if Bob is truthful.
