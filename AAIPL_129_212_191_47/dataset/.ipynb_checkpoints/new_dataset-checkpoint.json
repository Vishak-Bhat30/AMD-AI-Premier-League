Since B and C are of the same tribe, C is also a Liar. But C's statement 'A is a Liar' would be true, a contradiction. Therefore, A is a Truth-teller, B is a Truth-teller, and C is a Liar. If A is a Liar, B is lying and C is telling the truth, but C stating A is a Liar is actually true, a contradiction. The only possibility is that A is a Truth-teller, B is a Truth-teller, and C is a Liar.  If A is a liar, B and C are the same, B is lying, so he is a liar. C is also a liar, but that means what he says is false, so A is not a liar. contradiction. A is truthful, so B and C are different. Since A is a truth teller, B is a truth teller. Since A is a truth teller, C is a liar. Therefore A, B, and C are Truth, Truth, Liar, but that is not an option. So there is an error. If A is a liar, B and C are the same.

Since A is a Truth-teller, B is a Truth-teller and C is a Liar. A is a truth-teller, so B is a Truth-teller and C is a liar. A's answer is wrong. A says B and C are not of the same tribe, which means one is truthful and the other is a liar. B says A is a truth teller. C says A is a liar. Only one of them is telling the truth. Therefore, A is lying. This means B and C are of the same tribe. This means, B is lying, and C is lying. But this would mean C is telling the truth. Contradiction. A must be lying.

If A is the Robot, then A could be telling the truth and B is lying and C is telling the truth. However, if A is lying, then B is telling the truth (A is the missile). Then C is lying because there's already a gun (B). This is impossible. So, A is the Gun and B is the Missile. If C is the Gun, then A is the missile. A cannot be the gun. B says A is the missile, which is true, so it cannot be. C cannot be telling the truth. If C is the missile, then more than one gun exists so it is impossible. Therefore the missile is A.

Thus, A and B are Verax, and C is Falsax, totaling two Verax. However, if A is truthful and B is also truthful, then they are the same type, but the statement by A indicates only 1 falsax. Hence, A must be falsax and lying. Therefore, there must be zero falsax. But if A is lying, this is a contradiction. Assume A is falsax. So, A is lying when he says 'Exactly one of us is a Falsax'. This means there are not exactly one Falsax. If B is Verax, then A is Verax, contradiction. If B is Falsax, then A is Falsax. If C is Verax, then A is Falsax. This is possible. So B and A are falsax, and C is verax. This also violates A. They must all be Verax. Hence all three are Verax.",

But A is also Verax, contradicting the claim that *exactly one* is Falsax if A is Verax. Therefore, A must be Falsax. If A is Falsax, then \"exactly one of us is Falsax\" is a lie. This means either zero or more than one are Falsax. Since A is Falsax, we need to find one more Falsax. If B is Verax, then A is Verax, which is impossible. So B is Falsax. This makes C a Verax.

Therefore, B must be a Lie, and there are two Lies (A and B). Now, assume A is a Truth. Then A's statement is true ('Exactly one of us is a Lie'). If A is a Truth, then B's statement must be true ('A is a Truth'), and C's statement must be false ('A is a Lie'). This means B is a Truth and C is a Lie. Therefore, there is exactly one Lie (C), which makes A's statement true, and A is a Truth. Both scenarios are logically consistent. However, if A were a Lie, there would be two Lies, making A's statement false. Since A's statement must be false, there are two Lies, so we have two consistent scenarios. A cannot be a lie. Therefore A must be a truth. If A is a Truth, C is a Lie. Thus the assumption that A is a Truth is logically consistent, and so A is a Truth.",

If Robot 3 is Gun, then it's not Missile. If Robot 3 is Missile, then it is Missile, which is a contradiction. So Robot 3 is not Missile. If Robot 3 is Random, it might or might not be Missile. Because Robot 3 cannot be the Missile, Robot 2 must be the Missile since Robot 1 stated it was Random, meaning it could not be the missile. Therefore, Robot 2 is the Missile.",

Since Vorn is already a Knave, then Thalon's statement that exactly one person is a knave is false, so Thalon must be a Knave. Since Vorn is a Knave and Thalon is a Knave, Merek must be a Knave as well (because Thalon's statement is false). But Merek says 'Thalon is a Knight', which is a lie, so this works.

If Chloe is wearing a Black mask, Anya is NOT wearing White. Since Anya's statement doesn't uniquely define her mask, consider Boris. If Boris wears a Black mask, then Chloe doesn't wear a black mask. If Chloe wears a Red mask, then Anya wears white. But if Anya is wearing white, it is possible she is telling the truth (unlikely, but possible). Now, if Boris is wearing a Red mask, Chloe wears black. If Chloe wears black, Anya does NOT wear white.

Then the statement 'exactly one of us is a Liar' is false, meaning either zero or two or three are Liars. If A is a Liar, B's statement means they are from different tribes. If B is Truthful, they are from different tribes. This means one Liar and two Truthful. Contradicts statement of A. If B is a Liar, they are from the same tribe.

C says A is a Zang, which is consistent with A being a Zang. However, we have two Zangs, and A's statement that B and C are not of the same tribe is false, which is consistent with A being a Zang. So A: Zang, B: Zang, C: Zang is a valid scenario. Finally, assume A is a Zang. B is also lying, so B is a Zang. C is telling the truth, so C is saying A is a Zang, which is true.

If two are Weds (A and B), then B's statement, 'A and C are of the same tribe' is a lie, meaning A and C are of different tribes. But A is Wed, so C must be Zed. This works.

B says, 'C is from the Ban tribe.' C says, 'A is from the Zor tribe.' Therefore, only B is Zor, and A and C are Ban. The number of Ban is 2. Incorrect. We missed one more possibility.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Assume A is a Zub. Then B and C are of different tribes. If B is a Zub, then A is a Zub (consistent). Then C is a Zab, and C's statement that A is a Zab is a lie (consistent). So A is Zub, B is Zub, C is Zab. This gives one Zab. Assume A is a Zab. Then B and C are of the same tribe. Since A is a Zab, B's statement that A is a Zub is a lie, meaning B is a Zab. Since B and C are of the same tribe, C is also a Zab. But then C's statement that A is a Zab is the truth, contradicting C being a Zab. Thus, the only possibility is that A and B are Zubs, and C is a Zab. Because A is a Zub, B must lie, and B's statement that A is a Zub, must be a lie, so there is a contradiction there. So if A says 'B and C are different tribes', and we assume A is lying, then B and C are of the same tribe. If B is truthful when he says 'A is a Zub', then we have a contradiction, so B is also a Zab, and they are of the same tribe, then C is a Zab. If we accept A is a Zab then B and C are of the same type, and since B says A is a Zub, he must be lying, therefore a Zab, and so is C. This is a contradiction, so we test our first assumption, namely, that A is a Zub, so B and C are of different tribes. If B is a Zub, then A is a Zub(True), and C is a Zab, (true). Therefore, A is a Zub, B is a Zub, and C is a Zab. B cannot be a Zub, so B must be lying, so A is a Zab, which is a contradiction. Then A must be a Zub, B must be lying, so A is a Zub, which is true. So if A is a Zub, and B is lying, then C is a Zub. There are two Zabs.",

However, if both A and B are Bans, then A would be lying that he and B are of the same tribe, but B would be lying that C is a Ban. If C were a Zor, C would have told the truth that A is a Zor. But that would mean A is a Zor and Ban which is impossible. Thus, A must be lying that he and B are of the same tribe and B is a Zor, so C is a Ban. Therefore, the assumption that A is a Ban leads to a contradiction, so A must be a Zor. Therefore, B is a Zor, and C is a Ban. The question asks who is C. Thus the answer is A.",

If Agent Y is telling the truth, then Y is innocent, and both X and Z are lying. If X is lying, Y is not guilty, meaning Z must be guilty. But if Z is lying, X is telling the truth, a contradiction. If Agent Z is telling the truth, then X is lying. If X is lying, then Y is not guilty. So Y is telling the truth, and there would be two truth-tellers, a contradiction. Thus, only Agent X telling the truth is valid, meaning Agent Y is guilty. But the question says only one is telling the truth, thus X must be lying. If X is lying, Y is not guilty. Since only one is guilty, Y is not guilty. If Y is lying, Y is guilty, a contradiction. Thus, Agent X is lying. Assume that Agent X is guilty. Then both agents Y and Z are telling the truth, that is a contradiction. Therefore, there is a problem in the original question. The original question is that only one agent is telling the truth. That cannot be the case. Assume Agent X is guilty, then Y and Z will tell the truth, and there will be two persons telling the truth. If Agent Y is guilty, X is telling the truth. So Agent X is the only truth teller. If Agent Z is guilty, then Y is telling the truth. But then there are two truth tellers! Since only one agent is telling the truth, Agent X is telling the truth and Y is the guilty party. However, if only one is telling the truth, then it can be concluded that Agent X is lying. So Agent X cannot be guilty. If we suppose that Agent Z is guilty, then Agent Y is telling the truth. This violates the rules of the game. Therefore, Agent X is guilty and the guilty party is Agent X.",

Since both Thalon and Vorn are Knaves, Merek must be lying as well. If only one was a Knave it would make Merek truthful. Therefore, Merek is also a Knave. However, this contradicts Thalon's statement that exactly one is a Knave. There must be two Knaves, as both Thalon and Vorn are Knaves, and Merek must be truthful in stating that Thalon is a Knight, however, this is impossible. Thalon must be a Knave to start, and Vorn is a Knave. Merek must be a Knight to keep Thalon's statement false. Meaning there are only two Knaves.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Assume A is a Liar. Then A's statement is false, meaning either zero or two or three people are liars. Since A is a liar, at least one liar exists. If B is Truthful, then A is Truthful, a contradiction. Therefore, B must be a Liar. But if B is a Liar, then A is a Liar, so two liars exist. However, we need to check C. If C is Truthful, then we would only have two liars, A and B, which satisfies A's original (false) statement. But, if C is a Liar, then there would be 3 liars. Again, A's statement is still false. So, A being a liar does not lead to a contradiction. Now, let's assume A is Truthful. Then exactly one person is a liar. Since A is truthful, neither B nor C is a liar. Thus, B must be truthful, and C must be truthful as well. However, since B said that A is Truthful, and A is Truthful, it is a contradiction to suppose that only one of them is a liar. Therefore, A must be the Truthful.",

Then A's statement is false, meaning A and B are of the same tribe. So B is also a Ban. Then B's statement \"C is a Ban\" is false, meaning C is a Zor. Since C says \"A is a Zor\", C is lying, but this contradicts C being a Zor. Therefore, the assumption that A is a Ban is false. The only consistent solution is A is Zor, B is Ban, and C is Zor. Thus, B is a Ban. Note: A is a Zor, not 'A Zor'.",

Since A is Zor, C's statement \"A is a Zor\" is true, so C is a Zor. But this contradicts the statement of A, which is assumed to be true. Hence, A cannot be Zor. Thus, A must be Ban. Now, since A is Ban, B and C are of the same tribe. Since A is Ban, B's statement \"A is a Ban\" is true, so B is a Zor. Since A is Ban, C's statement \"A is a Zor\" is false, so C is a Ban.

Because A is Ban, C's statement \"A is a Zor\" is false, therefore C is a Ban. Because B is Zor and C is Ban, they are NOT the same tribe, so A must be telling the truth, and thus we have a contradiction. Let's start from the top, but say that A is Ban. Then, B and C must be of the same tribe. Since A is Ban, B's statement \"A is Ban\" is TRUE, so B must be Zor. Since A is Ban, C's statement \"A is Zor\" is FALSE, so C must be Ban.

If C is a Lie, then A is a Lie (consistent), implying B is also a Lie. But if B is a Lie, then A is a Lie (consistent). So if A is a Lie both B and C are Lies. Then C's statement is false, meaning C is from the Lie tribe. B's statement is false, meaning B is from the Lie tribe. A's statement is false meaning B and C are from the same tribe. Hence if A is a Lie there are 0 truths. The only solution that avoids contradictions is that A and B are truths and C is a lie. Therefore, there are two Truths.",

Now, assume Beta is the Gun. Then Beta's statement is true, so Gamma is the Gun, contradicting our assumption. Finally, assume Gamma is the Gun. Then Gamma's statement \u201cI am the Robot\u201d is false. But if Gamma is the Gun, it must tell the truth. Therefore, only the first scenario holds true - Beta is the Missile, Gamma is the Robot, and Alpha is NOT the Gun. This also means Beta cannot be the gun. Given that Beta's statement is that 'Gamma is the Gun', and Beta is the Missile, then that statement is a lie. That means Gamma is NOT the Gun. If Gamma is not the Gun and Alpha is not the Gun, then Beta must be the Gun. This is an important deduction step because we have to isolate each role to one robot. If Beta is the Gun, then 'Gamma is the Gun' is a truthful statement, which is impossible because we said that Gamma is NOT the Gun. From this we can conclude Gamma is not the Robot either. Now, assume Beta is the Missile (liar). Then Beta's statement that 'Gamma is the Gun' is a lie, and so Gamma is NOT the Gun. Then, the Gun is either Alpha or Gamma. Now, either Gamma is the Gun or Alpha is the Gun. Gamma cannot be the Gun since Beta's statement says that Gamma is the Gun, which is a lie, therefore Gamma is not the Gun.

Vorn's statement, \"I am a Liar,\" is true, which contradicts Vorn being a Liar. Therefore, Thalon must be a Liar. This means that not exactly one of them is a Liar. Since Thalon is lying about the number of liars, there must be either zero or two or three liars. If Vorn is a Liar, he is telling the truth, a contradiction. Hence, Vorn is a Truth-teller. Since there are not zero Liars (Thalon is a Liar), there must be two Liars. Thalon and one of the other two. Since Vorn is a Truth-teller, Merek must be a Truth-teller, and therefore Thalon and Vorn are the only Truth-tellers on the island.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Assume Alex wears a red mask. Then Alex is telling the truth, so he wears a red mask, which is consistent. Assume Alex wears a black mask. Then Alex is lying, so he is NOT wearing a red mask, which is consistent with him wearing a black mask. If Alex wears a white mask, he could be telling the truth or lying. Now, let's analyze Ben's statement. If Alex wears a red mask, Ben is lying, so Ben wears a black mask. If Alex wears a black mask, Ben is lying, so Ben wears a black mask. Now, let's analyze Chris's statement. If Ben wears a black mask, Chris is telling the truth, so Chris wears a red mask. If Alex wears a red mask, Chris wears a red mask. If Alex wears a black mask, Chris wears a red mask. Now, If Alex wears a white mask, Ben says Alex is wearing a white mask. If Alex is telling the truth, then Ben is telling the truth, so Ben is wearing red. If Alex is lying, then Ben is lying, so Ben is wearing black. Then Chris says Ben is wearing black. If Ben is wearing black, Chris is telling the truth and wearing red. If Ben is wearing red, Chris is lying and wearing black. Since A is the only one who could wear the white mask, the answer is C.",

If A is a Knave, then it is NOT true that exactly one of them is a Knave, meaning there are either zero or two or three Knaves. However, if A is a Knave, both B and C cannot be Knights since they contradict each other, meaning B and C are Knaves.

Also, R1's statement \"R2 is the Missile\" is false, so R1 is not the Gun. If R2 is the Gun then R3 is not the Gun, and since R2 is the Gun, R2 is telling the truth. Therefore R3 is not the Gun.

This violates the condition that only one is a Ban. Therefore, Xala is not the Ban. Assume Yorg is the Ban. Then Yorg's statement is false, meaning Zinn is not a Ban (Zinn is a Zor). Xala's statement is true, so Yorg and Xala are from different tribes. Therefore Xala is a Zor. Since exactly one is the Ban, this holds. Assume Zinn is the Ban. Then Zinn's statement is false, meaning Xala is not a Zor (Xala is a Ban). Xala's statement is true meaning she and Yorg are from different tribes. Since Xala is a Ban, Yorg is a Zor. This would make two Bans, contradicting the given constraint. Since only Yorg as the Ban satisfies all conditions, it's impossible. If Xala is the Ban, then her statement is false, so she and Yorg are from the same tribe, meaning Yorg is a Ban which contradicts the condition that exactly one is a Ban. Hence Xala is a Zor, and Yorg is the Ban. So only Zinn can be the Ban. If Zinn is the Ban, Yorg is a Zor. Xala's statement would be true, so they're from different tribes which means Xala is a Zor. Zinn says that Xala is a Zor. Since Zinn is a Ban, this is false. Hence, Xala is a Ban, contradiction. Finally if we assume Yorg is the Ban, then Yorg's statement is false, which means Zinn is a Zor. Since Xala is telling the truth she and Yorg are from different tribes, thus Xala is a Zor. This gives us exactly one Ban so the answer is Yorg. If we assume Xala is the Ban, then the statement is false, so she and Yorg are from the same tribe. Thus Yorg is a Ban, so we have two bans which can't be true. Since we have exactly one ban, Xala can't be a ban. Therefore Xala is the Ban.",

C's statement \"A is a Zo\" would be false, which is consistent with C being a Ban. So, A and B are Zo, and C is a Ban. This gives one Ban. Assume A is a Ban. Then B is also a Ban. B's statement \"C is a Ban\" is false, making C a Zo. C's statement \"A is a Zo\" is false, which contradicts C being a Zo. Therefore, the only valid solution is where A and B are Zo, and C is a Ban. Since B is a Zo, his statement that C is a Ban, must be true. So C is a Ban. Since A is a Zo, A's statement 'B and I are from the same tribe' must be true. So B is also a Zo. Therefore, there is exactly one Ban: C. However, the question asks how many Bans are present, not who is a Ban. If A is Ban, then B is Ban, and C is Zo. C says A is Zo which is false. This aligns. If A is Zo, then B is Zo, and C is Ban. C says A is Zo, which is true. So A and B must be from the same tribe. If A is Zo, then B is Zo, and C is Ban. If A is Ban, then B is Ban, and C is Zo. In the first case, 1 Ban, in the second case, 2 Bans. So, test each possibility again. If only one ban, then C is the only ban. A is Zo, B is Zo, C is Ban. A says B and I are same (True), B says C is Ban (True), C says A is Zo (True) - contradiction. If Two Bans, then A and B are Ban and C is Zo.

Since Zel is a Falsis, his statement that he is a Falsis is a lie, which confirms he is a Falsis. Yor claims Xal is a Veris. If Yor is a Veris, then Xal is a Veris. Xal says Yor and Zel are not of the same tribe. Since Yor is Veris and Zel is Falsis, Xal is telling the truth, so Xal is Veris. This is possible. However, if Yor is a Falsis, then Xal is also a Falsis. Xal states that Yor and Zel are not the same tribe. But we know that Yor is a Falsis, and Zel is a Falsis. This means Xal lied, so Xal is a Falsis. Yor is a Falsis and lied about Xal being a Veris. Therefore, Yor is a Veris and Xal is a Falsis. So, Xal is Falsis, Yor is Veris, and Zel is Falsis. Thus, C is the correct answer.",

So Gamma cannot be the Robot, and since Beta is the Missile, Gamma must be the Gun, which contradicts our initial assumption. So Alpha cannot be the Gun.\n\nAssume Beta is the Gun. Then Beta tells the truth, so Gamma is the Robot. If Gamma is the Robot, Gamma can say anything, including 'Alpha is the Gun'. If Alpha is the Missile, then it fits. So Beta is the Gun, Gamma is the Robot and Alpha is the Missile.\n\nAssume Gamma is the Gun. Then Alpha is the Gun, leading to a contradiction from the first assumption. \n\nTherefore, Alpha is the Missile, Beta is the Gun, and Gamma is the Robot. Thus, Alpha is the Robot is false. Therefore, Alpha is the Missile, Beta is the Gun, and Gamma is the Robot. So the Robot is Gamma. However, Beta says Gamma is the Robot, thus Beta is telling the truth and must be the Gun. If Beta is the Gun, Gamma is the Robot. Thus, Alpha must be the Missile because Alpha says Beta is the Missile, which is false. Thus, the answer must be Alpha is the robot, not Gamma. The problem is if Beta is the gun, and says Gamma is the Robot, and Gamma is the robot and says Alpha is the Gun, then Alpha is the missile. If Alpha is the Missile and says Beta is the Missile, it tells a lie. So Beta is the Gun, Alpha is the Missile, and Gamma is the Robot. Therefore, the robot is Gamma. But this contradicts the above logic. Let's examine our steps again.\n\nIf Beta is the Gun, then Gamma is the robot. If Gamma is the Robot, his statement is allowed to be any statement. So if Alpha is the Missile, and says that Beta is the Missile, then it lies. This is correct.\n\nAssume Alpha is the Robot. Then Alpha says 'Beta is the Missile' can be true or false. If it's true, Beta is the Missile. Thus, Gamma is the Gun. Since Gamma says Alpha is the Gun, then Gamma is lying, thus making Alpha not the Robot. This is a contradiction. This means Alpha CANNOT be the robot. \n\nIf Gamma is the Robot, we can assume Alpha is the Missile, and Beta is the Gun. But Alpha's statement is 'Beta is the Missile'. Since Alpha is lying, then it could be the missile. But if Beta is the Gun, Beta tells the truth. If Beta says 'Gamma is the Robot', then he tells the truth. If Gamma says 'Alpha is the Gun', and he is the robot, he could be lying. This configuration works. But there has to be one answer. \n\nIf Alpha is the robot, alpha says beta is the missile. If this is true, then Beta is the missile. Thus Gamma is the gun, and Gamma says Alpha is the gun, therefore gamma is lying, and it's no longer the gun. This is a contradiction. \n\nLet's revisit our initial assumption: Assume Alpha is the Gun. This means Beta is the Missile, meaning Gamma can't be the robot, which makes Gamma the Gun and that is a contradiction. Thus Alpha cannot be the gun. \nAssume beta is the gun. Beta says Gamma is the Robot. If Gamma is the robot, he can say anything. Suppose Alpha is the missile and says Beta is the missile. If that's true, Alpha is lying. This works. \nAssume Gamma is the gun. Gamma says Alpha is the gun. This is a contradiction. Thus Gamma can't be the gun. Thus Beta must be the gun. Thus Gamma is the Robot. \n\nWhat if Alpha is the robot? Then what does Alpha say? Gamma is the missile. Then Beta is the gun. Then Gamma says Alpha is the gun, then this is a lie, and it is consisten with Gamma being the missile. Then we have two missiles and no robot. This does not work. \n\nIf Gamma is the robot, then we have beta as the gun and then alpha as the missile. This fits our condition. If Beta is the gun, it tells the truth that Gamma is the robot. Thus Alpha is the Missile. But it is the Robot. Contradiction. If Alpha is the Robot, then Alpha says Beta is the missile. However, beta cannot be the missile because Gamma has to be the gun. So Alpha is not the Robot. The question then becomes. If Beta is the robot. Then gamma is the gun. Then alpha is the missile. That is 3 characters. No. Gamma cannot be the gun because Beta is the robot. So who can be the robot? What does Beta have to say. Gamma is the Robot. Gamma is the gun. Thus Alpha is the missile. If Gamma is the gun, then Alpha is the gun, which we already proved before, that Alpha cannot be the gun. It has to be Alpha that is the robot. However, that means that the gamma statement is true. Thus gamma cannot be the gun, because only beta is the gun. Thus we have two robots. Contradiction.\nFinal Answer: Alpha",

Now, since A is lying, either B or C (or both) are Zorns. Since exactly one person is a Zorn, and A is not, either B or C must be the Zorn. If C is the Zorn, then C's statement 'A is a Barb' is true, which it must be. But if C is a Zorn, his statement should be true, making A a Barb, which is correct. If B is the Zorn, then his statement that 'A is a Zorn' is true. However, we already know A is a Barb, which makes B a Barb too. Therefore, B cannot be a Zorn. If B is the Zorn, B's statement must be true, meaning that A is a Zorn. But A is lying, so A is a Barb. And B's statement is 'A is a Zorn'. Now we have 2 Zorns which violates the statement 'Exactly one person is a Zorn'. Therefore, C cannot be the Zorn either. Therefore, B must be telling the truth. Therefore, B is a Zorn, and A is a Barb. Now, let's assume that B is the Zorn. Then B's statement 'A is a Zorn' is true. This is impossible because A is a Barb. Therefore, B must be telling the truth, and A is not a Zorn. This means that C must be the Barb and must be lying. Therefore, since C is a Barb, C's statement is false, and A is a Zorn, which leads to a contradiction. It can't be A either. Let us assume B is the Zorn. Then B's statement 'A is a Zorn' is true. However, we know that A must be the Barb to satisfy the conditions. The statement 'Exactly one person is a Zorn' is incorrect. Thus, we must re-evaluate. If only B is telling the truth, and A and C are liars, then A is a Barb, and C is a Barb, and B is a Zorn. Since B is the Zorn, his statement, A is a Zorn, must be true. However, it is not. So B cannot be the Zorn. Because this leads to a contradiction. But since exactly one person is a Zorn, B must be the zorn. The only Zorn possible is B.",

Then Agent Y's statement \"I am the Robot\" could be true or false, depending on whether the robot is lying or not. If Agent X's statement, \"Agent Y is the Missile,\" is true, Agent X is the Gun. This leaves Agent Z as the Robot. Agent Z's statement becomes \"Agent X is the Gun\" which is true, meaning that agent Z would be the gun too, an impossibility.

If X is wearing a Black mask, his statement is false, which is consistent. If X is wearing a White mask, his statement could be true or false. Now consider Y. If Y is wearing a Red mask, the statement \"X is wearing a black mask\" is true, meaning X has a Black mask. If Y is wearing a Black mask, the statement \"X is wearing a black mask\" is false, meaning X does not have a Black mask. If Y is wearing a White mask, the statement could be true or false. Now consider Z. If Y has a Red mask, then Z says, \"Y is wearing a white mask.\" This is false, making Z have a Black mask. If Y has a Black mask, then Z says, \"Y is wearing a white mask.\" This is false, making Z have a Black mask. If Y has a White mask, then Z says, \"Y is wearing a white mask.\" This is either true or false depending on which time the white mask tells the truth. Since X says he is wearing a red mask, if he is telling the truth, Y would be lying and cannot be a red mask. Thus Y is wearing a Black mask, since if Y was wearing a white mask there would be no solution.",

If C is a Ban, his statement \"A is a Ban\" is false, also consistent. So, A and one of either B or C are Zorn, and the other is Ban. This means one other person is Ban. Total BANS = 2. Assume A is Ban. Then it is not true that exactly one is Ban. This means the other two must be Zorn. If A is Ban, then his statement that exactly one is Ban is false as there are more than 1 Ban. Thus, the number of Bans is 2, which means B and C are Bans because they can't be Zorn. If B is Zorn, he'd be telling the truth that A is Zorn, but A is Ban, so this doesn't work. If C is Zorn, he'd be telling the truth that A is Ban, but A is Zorn. This doesn't work. Therefore A cannot be Ban because it forces B and C to be Zorn which contradict the statement that A is Ban, meaning A is Zorn. If A is Zorn, B and C cannot both be Zorn, so at least 1 of them are Ban. If they were both Ban, A's statement would be false. Thus, one of them is Zorn and the other is Ban. This means that A and one of the others are Zorn. Therefore, there are two Bans.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Assume Thalon is Verax. Then Merek and Vorn are not both Verax. If Merek is Verax, Vorn is Falsax, which is consistent. If Merek is Falsax, Vorn can be either. Now assume Thalon is Falsax. Then Merek and Vorn are both Verax. This means Merek's statement that Vorn is a Falsax is false, which contradicts Merek being Verax. Hence, Thalon must be Verax. If Thalon is Verax, Merek says Vorn is Falsax. If Merek is Verax, then Vorn is Falsax. Vorn then lies and says Thalon is Verax. So Merek is Verax, Vorn is Falsax, and Thalon is Verax. But Thalon says that Merek and Vorn aren't both Verax. That's possible, so we look for a possible other solution. If Thalon is Verax, then not both Merek and Vorn are Verax. If Merek is Falsax, Vorn's statement that Thalon is Verax, implies that Vorn is lying, so Vorn is Falsax. Hence, Merek and Vorn are both Falsax. Because Thalon says Merek and Vorn are not both Verax, this situation is true. But then Merek is lying and says that Vorn is Falsax. And Vorn is lying saying that Thalon is Verax. Now if Merek is Verax and Vorn is Falsax. Then Vorn lies when he says that Thalon is Verax. And Merek is telling the truth that Vorn is Falsax. So Thalon can be Verax, Merek is Verax and Vorn is Falsax. This means that the original statement is true, so this works. If Thalon is Verax, and Vorn is Verax then Merek is falsax. Then Merek would be lying when he says Vorn is falsax. Thalon is still Verax. So if Thalon is verax, it's possible.",

Then it is false that exactly one of them is a Knave. That means there are either 0 or 2 or 3 Knaves. If Merek is a Knight then Vorn is a Knight, so there are only one Knave (Thalon) which is a contradiction. If Merek is a Knave then Vorn is a Knave, this would mean there are 3 Knaves, which is also a contradiction as Vorn's statement, 'Thalon is a Knave' would be true.

Since A states that exactly one person is a liar and A is lying, more than one person is a liar. Therefore, B must also be lying. Since B is lying, A is not a truther.

If B is a Ban, then 'We are not all Zo's' is a lie, meaning they ARE all Zo's, contradicting that exactly one is a Ban. Therefore, C must be the Ban. Since A said exactly one is a Ban truthfully and C is lying, A is a Zo and C is a Ban. B's statement is true, so B is a Zo. But, we assumed only one Ban, which is a contradiction. So A is a Ban, meaning his statement, 'Exactly one of us is a Ban', is a lie. So either 0 or 2-3 are Bans. B's statement, 'We are not all Zo's' is true. C's statement 'A is a Zo' is false. So C is a Ban, confirming A is a Ban. Therefore, only B is a Zo is false. A and C must be Bans, making B a Zo. However, this violates A's original statement about exactly one ban. Therefore, we made an error. Let's reconsider A being a Zo means either B or C is a ban. If B is a ban, they are all Zo's - contradiction. If C is a ban, A and B are Zo's. However, A is claiming only one is a ban, implying B is telling the truth, which means they are NOT all Zo's. So A cannot be a Zo. A is a Ban, meaning 0 or 2-3 are Bans. B cannot be a Ban, because if so, they are all Zo's. Thus, A and C must be Bans. But C is saying A is a Zo. Contradiction. Let's assume B is a Zo. So not all are Zo's. C is a Ban. A is a Ban.

If C is a Ban, B's statement is false, implying C is a Ban. So far so good. However, if B is a Zor, then C's statement 'A is a Ban' is true, which is a contradiction to our original assumption that A is a Zor. Now, assume A is a Ban. Then A's statement is false, meaning either zero or two or three are Bans. C's statement 'A is a Ban' is true, so C must be a Zor. B's statement is 'C is a Zor' which is true, therefore B is also a Zor. This means that there are two Zors (B and C) and one Ban (A). Since A's statement 'Exactly one of us is a Ban' is false, which it should be if A is a Ban. So A must be a Ban. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

Then C must be Missile, and C's statement is false, which is consistent. This scenario works. Assume A is Missile. Then A's statement is false. B cannot be Gun because then B's statement would be true (that A is Robot), which is impossible if A is Missile. So B must be Robot. Then C is Gun and says B is Missile, which is impossible, since we assumed B is Robot. Assume A is Robot. Then A's statement can be either true or false. If A is Robot and lies, then B cannot be Gun because it means B's statement is false (A being Robot). So B must be Missile. C would be Gun and say that B is Missile (consistent). But A could also be Robot and tell the truth. If A is Robot and tells the truth, then B cannot be Missile because that would contradict B's statement. So B must be Gun, which means that B's statement is true. This implies C must be Missile who is lying. So A is Robot. C cannot be Robot (since we can be certain of the others). Thus A must be Robot. The only possible scenario where the statements do not contradict is where A is Gun, B is Robot, and C is Missile. But the question asks who the Robot is and this is not possible to deduct, making it impossible to deduct. The question has no possible scenario where we can deduct the answer. If C is missile, then B is robot and A is gun. This satisfies A being gun. If B is robot, A cannot be gun (A would be lying). If A is robot then B is missile. So C is gun. The question is who is the robot? So it can be either A or B. Thus the answer is D.",

Since Gun's statement implicates Missile, and Missile's statement contradicts Robot's, then Robot must be the one who can lie or tell the truth (Robot). If Robot IS telling the truth, then Missile is the Liar, and Gun must be the Truth-Teller. It's possible that Robot stole the plans. This is consistent with the statements. If Missile stole the plans, Robot is a Truth-teller, and Gun is a truth-teller (which we know to be true), then Missile is lying, which we know to be true.

If A is a Lie, A's statement is false, meaning it's not true that exactly one is a Lie. If B is a truth, A and C are of the same type, which is lie, meaning C is a lie. C's statement says that A is a Truth, which is false as we assumed. This is consistent. If B is a lie, A and C are of different types. Since A is a lie, C is a Truth. C says A is a Truth, which is false, so C is a lie. It means there are three lies (A, B, C), which means A lied when he said that exactly one is a lie. Then, A must be a Truth. If A is a Lie, then at least two are Lies. But C's statement \"A is a Truth\" is false, so C is a lie, which means there are already two lies (A and C). B cannot be a truth, because that would mean A and C are of the same type, which is Lie. B must also be a lie. Thus, A, B, and C are all Lies, making A's original statement false, as required.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Assume A is the Bano. Then A's statement \"B is a Bano\" is false, meaning B is a Zorn. B's statement \"C and I are of different tribes\" would then be true, meaning C is a Bano. This contradicts the constraint of exactly one Bano. Assume B is the Bano. Then A's statement is true (B is a Bano), meaning A is a Zorn. B's statement is false (C and B are of the same tribe), meaning C is also a Bano. This contradicts the constraint of exactly one Bano. Assume C is the Bano. Then A's statement is true (B is a Zorn). B's statement \"C and I are of different tribes\" would be true, so B is a Zorn. C's statement \"A is a Zorn\" would be false since C is a Bano and is lying. But we deduced A and B are Zorns. This contradicts the constraint of exactly one Bano. If we assume only B is the Bano, A's statement that B is a Bano is true, so A is a Zorn. B's statement 'C and I are of different tribes' is false, so C is a Bano. Since we are told only one is a Bano, this is a contradiction. Thus, only B can be the Bano, but this contradicts the problem statement. If we correct B's statement to 'C and I are of THE SAME tribe', and B is the only Bano, then C must also be a Bano. BUT exactly one is a Bano. Consider that C says A is a Zorn, and A says B is a Bano. Only B is a Bano. Then A is Zorn. C's statement is true, so C is Zorn. So then A must be Zorn, B must be Bano and C must be Zorn. A is Zorn, saying B is Bano (TRUE). B is Bano, saying C and I are different (FALSE). C is Zorn, saying A is Zorn (TRUE). Exactly one is Bano.",

This is consistent so far. If A is Missile, B's statement is true, so B is Gun. Then C must be Robot. C's statement is false, but Robot can lie, so no contradiction. Now assume A is Robot. Then A's statement can be true or false. If A's statement is true (A is Robot), then B's statement is false, so A is not Missile (consistent). If A is Robot, and B is Missile, then C is Gun, and C's statement is true. This implies C is Gun which is acceptable. If A is Robot, and B is Gun, then C is Missile, and C's statement is false, so C is NOT Gun. This implies A is Robot and can be either true or false. Since C's statement must be false, C must be Missile. And since B lied, A cannot be Missile. Now we know C is Missile. B says A is Missile, and is lying. Thus A is not Missile and B is not Gun (since B lied). B must be Robot. Thus A must be Gun, meaning it lied by saying 'I am Robot'. This leads to a contradiction. Thus A must be Robot. If A is Robot, the possibilities are open, but since B says 'A is Missile', we can deduce that C is the Missile. Therefore A is Robot, B is Gun and C is Missile. A said 'I am Robot', which is something a Robot can say. Then B said 'A is Missile' which is a lie, making B either a robot or a missile. But since C is the missile, B must be the robot. That makes A the gun. Then A said 'I am Robot' which leads to a contradiction. So A must be Robot. Then B would have to be the liar or the Robot and C would be the Gun. Therefore, A is the Robot. A cannot be the gun since Gun always tells the truth. And A cannot be missile because then his statement is false, but he is claiming not to be Robot so that's a contradiction. Therefore A must be Robot.",

So, B is Zub, C is Zab. Two Zubs, one Zab, contradicting A's statement. Therefore, A is a Zab. If A is a Zab, then B and C are of the same tribe. Since A is a Zab, B's statement \"A is a Zub\" is false, so B is a Zab. Since B is a Zab, and B and C are of the same tribe, C is also a Zab. A, B, and C are Zabs. However, C's statement 'A is a Zab' becomes true, which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that A is lying is also wrong. Let's re-evaluate. If A is a Zab then B and C are the same. If B is a Zub then A is a Zub (a contradiction, B must be a Zab). Since B is a Zab and B and C are the same, C is a Zab. C says A is a Zab, which is true (contradiction). Thus A must be a Zub. Therefore B and C are different. B says A is a Zub, which is true. Hence B is a Zub and C is a Zab. Thus A is Zub, B is Zub and C is Zab. So one Zab. Contradiction A's statement. Therefore B and C must both be Zabs, then A is lying, and so A is a Zab. A, B, and C are Zabs. But C says A is a Zab, which is true. So they can't all be Zabs. Start with A being a Zub. B and C are different. B says A is Zub, so B is Zub. C says A is Zab, so C is Zab. So one Zab and two Zubs. If we start with A being a Zab. Then B and C are the same. B says A is Zub, so B is a Zab. C must be a Zab. C says A is a Zab, which is true. So B and C cannot both be Zabs. Thus, we have A is a Zub, B is a Zub, and C is a Zab. However, A says B and C are not of the same tribe which is true. Thus we need to find another scenario, and that is A,B,C must both be Zabs and C has to be lying. Two Zabs are there.",

This leaves only 2 possibilities, that Gamma is either the missile or a robot. If Gamma is the missile, then Alpha is not the gun, and Alpha's statement that Beta is the missile has to be true. Since Gamma is the missile, Beta is not the missile, so the assumption that Alpha is the gun is wrong. Assume Gamma is the robot. If Gamma is the Robot, and Alpha says Beta is the Missile, then it means Beta is the missile. Gamma also says alpha is the gun. Since we have assumed it is a robot, there is no contradiction. However, if alpha is the gun, then beta has to be the missile. The statement from beta that gamma is the robot can be true as well. There is no contradiction. So we cannot assume Alpha is the gun. If we assume Beta is the gun, then gamma is the robot and beta's statement is true. From here, the only thing left is to determine that alpha is the missile. So the answer is B.",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Assume A is a Truth. Then A and B are from different tribes, and C is from the Truths. But if C is from the Truths, then A is from the Truths, which is consistent. If B is from the Lies, then C is from the Truths is false, meaning C is from the Truths. Thus A and B are of different tribes. Hence, if A is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar. Now, assume A is a Lie. Then A and B are from the same tribe. Also C is from the Truths is false, so C is from the Lies. If A is from the Lies, then A and B are both Lies. Then B's statement that C is from the Lies is a lie, implying C is from the Truths. This is a contradiction. Therefore, A must be from the Truths, and so B is from the Lies, and C is from the Truths. Since B is from the Lies, his statement that C is from the Lies is false, so C is from the Truths. Thus, B is a Lie, and both A and C are Truths. However, if A is a Truth, B and A are from different tribes, so B is a Lie. Since B is a Lie, C is from the Truths is false, hence C is from the Truths. Therefore A and C are Truths, and B is a Lie. The question asks how many Lies there are, which is 1. Let's examine if C is a Lie. If C is a Lie, then A is from the Lies. But A said, 'B and I are from different tribes' and since A is lying, A and B are from the same tribe, which is the Lies tribe. Then B's statement, 'C is from the Lies', would be truthful, meaning B is a Truth, which is a contradiction. Thus, A is truthful, and B is lying. If B is lying, then C is from the Truths, so C is truthful. Now, if there were 2 Lies, it would mean A is truthful, and B and C are lying. If B is lying, then C is from the Truths, which is a contradiction. Thus, there must be 2 Lies. Assume A is a Truth-teller. Then A and B are from different tribes. Since C says A is a Truth-teller, C is also a Truth-teller. Then B must be a Lie-teller. Hence only B is a lie teller. Assume A is a Lie-teller. Then A and B are from the same tribe. Since C says A is a Truth-teller, then C is also a Lie-teller. Then B must also be a Lie-teller. So A, B and C are all Lie-tellers, but that means A is lying about being from a different tribe, so that means all three can't be lies, so it must be that there are two lies and one truth. So B is lying, and C is lying. Meaning A is truthful, and thus, B and A are from different tribes. But that means that there has to be two lies. The answer is 2.",

Then Gamma is a Gun. If Gamma is a Gun, then Alpha is a Robot. If Alpha is a Robot, then Alpha could be lying, because he stated Beta is a Missile. This contradicts statement of Beta (Gamma is a Gun), since there can only be one Gun. Assume Gamma is the Gun. Then Alpha is a Robot. If Alpha is a Robot, then Alpha can make the statement that Beta is a missile, and be truthful. Because Gamma is a Gun, Beta's statement is false, therefore Beta is a Missile. This configuration works. The roles are: Gamma = Gun, Alpha = Robot, Beta = Missile. Therefore, only Gamma can be the Gun. If Gamma is a Gun, then Alpha is a Robot (true), so Alpha could either be telling the truth or lying. Alpha is correct if Beta is a missile. If Gamma is the Gun, then Beta lies and Gamma is not the Gun. Beta is a Missile. This is true and Gamma is the Gun. Hence Gamma is the Gun.",

Then Z's statement is potentially true or false, which is valid for the Robot. If Z's statement is true, then Z is indeed the Robot, and both X and Y are either Guns or Missiles. This would force Y to be the Gun, since Z is the Robot and X has to be the Missile, as Z being the Robot means X says Y is the Missile. Then Y is the Gun, and his statement is true, making Z the Gun. This is a contradiction, so Z is not the robot. Therefore, Z must be the Missile. Since Z is the Missile, Z's statement is false, meaning Z is NOT the Robot. Since Z is the Missile, Robot Y is telling the truth: Robot Z is the missile. Therefore, Robot Y is the Gun. Which leaves Robot X as the Robot. Therefore X: Robot, Y: Gun, and Z: Missile. However, X states Y is the Missile, so this cannot be true. This means that there is some sort of inherent contradiction in the statement of X. We know that X can be lying or truthful. We have established that Z is the Missile, so we know that Y is telling the truth. Therefore X is lying. Then X is the Missile, since they always lie. This leaves Robot Y as the Robot, and Robot Z as the Gun. If X is the Missile, his statement that Y is the missile is false. If Y is the Robot, then he can be either truthful or lying. This is not possible. However, we assumed that Y was telling the truth, which is wrong. Since Y is telling a lie, Z can not be the missile, as stated by Y.

But then Z's statement, 'X is wearing the White mask,' is a lie, consistent with Black. However, Y cannot wear the Red mask if X is wearing the Red mask. Contradiction! So, X doesn't wear the Red mask. Assume X wears the White mask. Then X's statement could be true or false. This doesn't give us a clear path. Assume X wears the Black mask. Then X's statement is a lie, so Y doesn't wear the Red mask. If Y wears the Red Mask, Z wears Black mask (Y telling truth). If Y wears Black mask, Z does not wear Black mask and Y is lying. But if Y wears White mask, Z could wear any mask. Since Y doesn't wear Red, and X wears Black, Z must wear Red to avoid same mask colors. Thus, Y is lying about Z wearing Black. All these possibilities means that it is possible for X to wear Black mask. Therefore, X is wearing the Black mask.",

If C is a Zorn, A is a Bani which is possible. If B is a Zorn, then C is a Zorn, then A is a Bani. Therefore B and C are the same, and A is different. So, B and C are from the same tribe. Then A makes the false statement, and since that makes A a Bani, then B and C are Zorns, meaning there are two Zorns. Since C's statement must be false, this means A is a Zorn, creating a contradiction. If C lies (C = Bani), A is also Bani. Then B says C is Zorn (lies), making B a Bani.

This creates a contradiction because B's statement 'A is a Knave' would be true, meaning B would be a Knight, and C's statement 'A is a Knight' would be false, meaning C would be a Knave, satisfying the initial assumption that A is a Knave.

This would mean Unit 922's statement that it is the Robot is false, which is a contradiction. Now, assume Unit 801 is the Gun. This means Unit 922 is the robot, which would mean Unit 922's statement is true. This contradicts Unit 801 being the gun. Now assume Unit 922 is the Gun, which means Unit 922 says it is the Robot is false. Contradiction. Therefore Unit 734 is the Missile which means Unit 801 is not a missile and Unit 734's statement is false. This is consistent. If Unit 734 is Missile, Unit 801 cannot be Missile. Unit 922 cannot be the Missile either, because if this is the case, then Units 801 statement is false.

If Gamma is the Robot, Gamma's statement can be true or false, but it states Alpha is the Robot which is false. Contradiction. Assume Beta is the Gun. Then Gamma is the Gun. Contradiction. Assume Gamma is the Gun. Then Alpha is the Robot. Then Beta is the Missile. Since Beta is the Missile, Gamma is NOT the Gun, which is true. This means Beta is lying. Therefore Beta is the Missile. Alpha is the Robot and Gamma is the Gun. Beta is the Missile. If Alpha is the Gun, then Beta is the missile. So beta is telling the truth which is a contradiction. Alpha cannot be the gun. If Beta is the Gun, then Gamma is the gun. Which is impossible. Therefore Gamma is the Gun. And the other two must be robot and missile. If Gamma is the gun, Alpha is the Robot, then Beta is lying. Therefore Beta is the Missile.",

If Merek is a Knave, his statement that Vorn is a Knight is false, making Vorn a Knave, which is also consistent. So, if Thalon is a Knight, there are two Knaves (Merek and Vorn). Assume Thalon is a Knave. Then it's false that exactly one is a Knave, meaning there are either zero or two Knaves. If Thalon is a Knave, then Vorn's statement that Thalon is a Knave is true, making Vorn a Knight. This contradicts Thalon's statement that there are zero or two Knaves because now we have at least one Knight and one Knave (Thalon). Then Merek must be a Knave as well in order to satisfy the zero or two Knaves condition. However, if Merek is a Knave, then Merek's statement \"Vorn is a Knight\" is false, which means Vorn must be a Knave. This is a contradiction.

If 3 are Zibs, A lied. So, A could be a Zib. If A is a Zub, then A's statement is true, so exactly one is a Zib. Now consider B's statement: 'A and C are of the same tribe.' If B is a Zub, then A and C are the same tribe. Since A is a Zub, C must be a Zub. This means there are zero Zibs, contradicting A's statement. Therefore, B must be a Zib, and A and C are of different tribes. But we already know A and C are Zubs. If A is a Zub, then exactly one person is a Zib. If B is a Zib, then A and C must be different tribes, which is true. Thus, A and C are Zubs, and B is a Zib. If A, B, and C are all Zubs, A's statement is false. A is not a Zib. A = Zub, C= Zub. Therefore, B is a Zub. This is impossible. If A and C are both Zubs, then B is a Zib. 'A and C are of the same tribe' is false, meaning B is a Zib. A says 'Exactly one of us is a Zib', so A is telling the truth. Therefore, A and C are Zubs and B is a Zib.",

Assume A is Zab: Then B and C are of the same tribe. If B is Zub, then A is Zub (contradiction). If B is Zab, then A is Zab (consistent), and C is also Zab (consistent). Therefore, A is a Zab. Option A fails because it assumes A is Zub and leads to contradictions. Option C fails because A's identity can be determined. Option D fails because the truth-teller/liar rules allow determination.",

Then Gamma's statement 'Alpha is a Gun' is true, which a Gun would say. This scenario is consistent. Now assume Beta is the Gun. Then Beta's statement 'I am a Robot' is true, so Beta is a Robot, contradiction. So Beta is not the Gun. Now Assume Gamma is the Gun. Then Alpha is not a Gun, and Gamma's statement that Alpha is a Gun is true. Since Gamma is the Gun it must be truthful. Thus, Gamma is the Gun. If Gamma is the gun, it is telling the truth when it says Alpha is a Gun. Since there is only one Gun, Gamma is the Gun, Alpha cannot be a Gun. Therefore C is the gun.",
