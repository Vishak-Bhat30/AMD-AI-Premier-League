The only consistent possibility is that A is the only truth‑teller: A’s claim (“B is a liar”) is true, so B lies when saying “C is a truth‑teller”—so C is a liar—and then C lies when saying “A is a liar.” That makes exactly one truth‑teller (A)."

  "question": "On an island, there are three types of people: Knights (always tell the truth), Knaves (always lie), and Spies (can either tell the truth or lie). You meet three individuals: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Alice says, 'Bob is a Knave or Carol is a Knight.' Bob says, 'If Alice is a Knight, then Carol is a Spy.' Carol says, 'I am a Spy, and at least one of Alice or Bob is a Knight.' Who among them is definitely a Knight, definitely a Knave, or definitely a Spy?",
