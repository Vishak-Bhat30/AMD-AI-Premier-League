Then A's statement is true, meaning B is a Ban. If B is a Ban, B's statement is false, making C a Ban. This contradicts C's statement (A is a Ban) because A would be a Zorn. Therefore, A must be a Ban. If A is a Ban, A's statement is false, meaning A and B are from the same tribe. Thus, B is also a Ban. If B is a Ban, B's statement is false, meaning C is a Ban. C's statement (A is a Ban) is now true, which is consistent since C is a Ban and must lie. However, this is impossible as C has to lie. So the initial assumption that A is a Zorn is wrong. If A is a Ban, then A's statement is false. Thus A and B are from the same tribe (Bans). B then lies, meaning C is a Ban. C lies meaning A is a Zorn. This is impossible because A is a Ban.

This is consistent so A is a Ban, B is a Ban, and C is a Ban. This is impossible because exactly one of them is a Zorn. If B is a Zorn, B's statement is true and C is a Zorn. This contradicts A being a Zorn. If A is a Ban, A's statement is false. This means A and B are the same tribe. B is a Ban. B's statement that C is a Zorn is false, meaning C is a Ban.

If Y is the Missile, then Y says he is the Robot, which is a lie (consistent). If Z says X is the Gun, Z is lying, which is consistent. So, the only option that allows X to be the Missile is A.

The question asks who is the Liar, so eliminate C. The question asks for a single Liar, but we know there are two, so the original statement must be false. Since both A and B are Liars, C must be the Truther. Re-read the question. It's \"Who is the liar\" not \"Who are the liars?\". Since A said \"exactly one of us is a liar\" and he is lying, there must be zero or two liars. If there are zero liars, then A is telling the truth, a contradiction. If there are two liars then B is lying, but he is stating that A is a truther, which is wrong, therefore B is lying. Therefore C is telling the truth, and A and B are liars. Since we need to determine who IS the liar, we assume C is the liar. That means A is telling the truth, but he cannot because only one is lying. Therefore A and B are the liars, but the answer must be singular. B stated A is a truther - but A is a liar. If B is a liar, the A is a liar - which does not contradict A's statement. Therefore C is not the liar. This means C is the truther, and B is a liar. Therefore, A must be the liar. But this contradicts B's statement, as B says A is a truther.

This is a contradiction, so let's review: A is a Ban, therefore B is not the same as A. This means B has to be Zor. If B is Zor, he states that C is Ban. This is true, so C is indeed a Ban. This means two Bans exist (A and C), which cannot be, as there is only one Ban.

However, X's statement on Wednesday is random, not necessarily true, so this does not contradict. Y's statement on Wednesday should be true, but Y says that it is NOT Wednesday and this creates a contradiction. However, if it is Wednesday, then Y's statement 'Today is not Wednesday' is a lie. Y always lies on Thursday, not Wednesday. If we assume Wednesday anyway, then X says 'Today is Monday' which is random. Y says 'Today is not Wednesday' which is a lie, because it is Wednesday. Z says 'Today is Saturday' which is random. This is possible. Consider the other solutions. If it were Monday, X would be telling the truth, so 'today is Monday' must be true. Y and Z are random.

So the original statement of 'A and B are from different tribes' is true, so A is a Zor. B lies that C is from the Zor tribe. C is a Ban. And C lies, saying that A is from the Ban tribe.

Then Beta tells the truth, so Gamma is the Robot. If Gamma is the Robot, Gamma can say anything, including 'Alpha is the Gun'. If Alpha is the Missile, then it fits. So Beta is the Gun, Gamma is the Robot and Alpha is the Missile.\n\nAssume Gamma is the Gun.

If Beta is the Gun, Gamma is the Robot. Thus, Alpha must be the Missile because Alpha says Beta is the Missile, which is false. Thus, the answer must be Alpha is the robot, not Gamma. The problem is if Beta is the gun, and says Gamma is the Robot, and Gamma is the robot and says Alpha is the Gun, then Alpha is the missile. If Alpha is the Missile and says Beta is the Missile, it tells a lie. So Beta is the Gun, Alpha is the Missile, and Gamma is the Robot. Therefore, the robot is Gamma. But this contradicts the above logic. Let's examine our steps again.\n\nIf Beta is the Gun, then Gamma is the robot. If Gamma is the Robot, his statement is allowed to be any statement. So if Alpha is the Missile, and says that Beta is the Missile, then it lies. This is correct.\n\nAssume Alpha is the Robot. Then Alpha says 'Beta is the Missile' can be true or false. If it's true, Beta is the Missile. Thus, Gamma is the Gun. Since Gamma says Alpha is the Gun, then Gamma is lying, thus making Alpha not the Robot. This is a contradiction. This means Alpha CANNOT be the robot. \n\nIf Gamma is the Robot, we can assume Alpha is the Missile, and Beta is the Gun. But Alpha's statement is 'Beta is the Missile'. Since Alpha is lying, then it could be the missile. But if Beta is the Gun, Beta tells the truth. If Beta says 'Gamma is the Robot', then he tells the truth. If Gamma says 'Alpha is the Gun', and he is the robot, he could be lying. This configuration works. But there has to be one answer. \n\nIf Alpha is the robot, alpha says beta is the missile. If this is true, then Beta is the missile. Thus Gamma is the gun, and Gamma says Alpha is the gun, therefore gamma is lying, and it's no longer the gun. This is a contradiction. \n\nLet's revisit our initial assumption: Assume Alpha is the Gun. This means Beta is the Missile, meaning Gamma can't be the robot, which makes Gamma the Gun and that is a contradiction. Thus Alpha cannot be the gun. \nAssume beta is the gun. Beta says Gamma is the Robot. If Gamma is the robot, he can say anything. Suppose Alpha is the missile and says Beta is the missile. If that's true, Alpha is lying. This works. \nAssume Gamma is the gun. Gamma says Alpha is the gun. This is a contradiction. Thus Gamma can't be the gun. Thus Beta must be the gun. Thus Gamma is the Robot. \n\nWhat if Alpha is the robot? Then what does Alpha say? Gamma is the missile. Then Beta is the gun. Then Gamma says Alpha is the gun, then this is a lie, and it is consisten with Gamma being the missile. Then we have two missiles and no robot. This does not work. \n\nIf Gamma is the robot, then we have beta as the gun and then alpha as the missile. This fits our condition. If Beta is the gun, it tells the truth that Gamma is the robot. Thus Alpha is the Missile. But it is the Robot. Contradiction. If Alpha is the Robot, then Alpha says Beta is the missile. However, beta cannot be the missile because Gamma has to be the gun. So Alpha is not the Robot. The question then becomes. If Beta is the robot. Then gamma is the gun. Then alpha is the missile. That is 3 characters. No. Gamma cannot be the gun because Beta is the robot. So who can be the robot? What does Beta have to say. Gamma is the Robot. Gamma is the gun. Thus Alpha is the missile. If Gamma is the gun, then Alpha is the gun, which we already proved before, that Alpha cannot be the gun. It has to be Alpha that is the robot. However, that means that the gamma statement is true.

How many Zorbans are from the Lies tribe?", "choices": ["A) 0", "B) 1", "C) 2", "D) 3"], "answer": "C", "explanation": "Assume A is a Truth. Then A and B are from different tribes, and C is from the Truths. But if C is from the Truths, then A is from the Truths, which is consistent. If B is from the Lies, then C is from the Truths is false, meaning C is from the Truths. Thus A and B are of different tribes. Hence, if A is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar. Now, assume A is a Lie. Then A and B are from the same tribe. Also C is from the Truths is false, so C is from the Lies. If A is from the Lies, then A and B are both Lies. Then B's statement that C is from the Lies is a lie, implying C is from the Truths. This is a contradiction. Therefore, A must be from the Truths, and so B is from the Lies, and C is from the Truths. Since B is from the Lies, his statement that C is from the Lies is false, so C is from the Truths. Thus, B is a Lie, and both A and C are Truths. However, if A is a Truth, B and A are from different tribes, so B is a Lie. Since B is a Lie, C is from the Truths is false, hence C is from the Truths. Therefore A and C are Truths, and B is a Lie. The question asks how many Lies there are, which is 1. Let's examine if C is a Lie. If C is a Lie, then A is from the Lies. But A said, 'B and I are from different tribes' and since A is lying, A and B are from the same tribe, which is the Lies tribe. Then B's statement, 'C is from the Lies', would be truthful, meaning B is a Truth, which is a contradiction. Thus, A is truthful, and B is lying. If B is lying, then C is from the Truths, so C is truthful. Now, if there were 2 Lies, it would mean A is truthful, and B and C are lying. If B is lying, then C is from the Truths, which is a contradiction. Thus, there must be 2 Lies. Assume A is a Truth-teller. Then A and B are from different tribes. Since C says A is a Truth-teller, C is also a Truth-teller. Then B must be a Lie-teller. Hence only B is a lie teller. Assume A is a Lie-teller. Then A and B are from the same tribe. Since C says A is a Truth-teller, then C is also a Lie-teller. Then B must also be a Lie-teller. So A, B and C are all Lie-tellers, but that means A is lying about being from a different tribe, so that means all three can't be lies, so it must be that there are two lies and one truth.

Then A's statement 'B and I are from different tribes' is true, so B is a Ban. If B is a Ban, B's statement 'C is a Ban' is false, so C is a Zora. C's statement 'A is a Zora' is true, which is consistent with our initial assumption. Thus, A and C are Zoras, and B is a Ban, so only 1 Ban is present. However, if C is a Zora, B has to be a Ban. If B is a Ban, A has to be a Ban, which contradicts the fact that A said that B and A are from different tribes. Thus, A must be a Ban. This means that A's statement, 'B and I are from different tribes' is false, implying that A and B are from the same tribe. Therefore, B is also a Ban. Since B is a Ban, B's statement 'C is a Ban' is false, implying that C is a Zora. C's statement 'A is a Zora' is also false, because we already know A is a Ban. So the assumption that A is a Ban is incorrect. Let's assume A is a Ban. Then, A's statement 'B and I are from different tribes' is false, meaning A and B are from the same tribe. Therefore, B is also a Ban. Since B is a Ban, the statement 'C is a Ban' is false, which means C is a Zora. So, A and B are Bans and C is a Zora, meaning there are two Bans present.
