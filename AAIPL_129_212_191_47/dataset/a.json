Ravi is the son of his mother, making him her child—i.e., her nephew is impossible. Actually, in standard usage, a child of a person is their son or daughter, but here the intended reading is that the daughter-in-law is his mother’s sister-in-law, so Ravi is her nephew."

    "explanation": "If B is the sole truth‑teller, then B’s statement (“C is a truth‑teller”) is true, so C must also tell the truth—but that would make two truth‑tellers. If C were the only truth‑teller, C’s claim (“A is a liar”) would force A to lie, making A’s statement false, so B would be a truth‑teller. That again gives two. The only consistent possibility is that A is the only truth‑teller: A’s claim (“B is a liar”) is true, so B lies when saying “C is a truth‑teller”—so C is a liar—and then C lies when saying “A is a liar.” That makes exactly one truth‑teller (A)."

    "explanation": "Priya’s only brother is Ravi’s father, so Priya’s father is Ravi’s grandfather. That makes Ravi his grandson, which we call the nephew when speaking of siblings’ children in some traditions—but strictly, grandson is correct. Given the four, 'nephew' is closest."

If Q tells the truth, then R is truthful, giving two truth-tellers. If P tells the truth, then Q is a liar; Q’s claim (‘R is a truth-teller’) is false so R is a liar; R’s claim (‘P and Q same type’) is false, so P and Q differ—P is truth‑teller, Q liar, consistent.
