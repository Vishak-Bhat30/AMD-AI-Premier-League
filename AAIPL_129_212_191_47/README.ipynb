If A and D are truth-tellers, then A's statement that B is a liar is true, and D's statement that A is a truth-teller is true. But B's statement that C is a truth-teller would be false, making B a liar, and C's statement that D is a liar would be false, making C a liar. This fits two truth-tellers (A and D) and two liars (B and C). However, if B and C are truth-tellers, then B's statement that C is a truth-teller is true, and C's statement that D is a liar is true, making D a liar. A's statement that B is a liar would be false, making A a liar, and D's statement that A is a truth-teller would be false, making D a liar. This gives two truth-tellers (B and C) and two liars (A and D). But if C and D are truth-tellers, then C's statement that D is a liar is false, which is a contradiction. The only consistent configuration is B and C being truth-tellers, but this contradicts C's statement. The correct configuration is C and D being truth-tellers, but this leads to a contradiction. The only consistent configuration is A and D being truth-tellers, making B and C liars.
